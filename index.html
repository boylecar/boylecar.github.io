                            <p>
                            Continuing my project from last week, I created a more precise
                            model to hold the watches and connect with the motor, and I built a simple wooden box to mount the 
                            motor to. I also made several changes to the programming so I can set the amount of turns per day
                            (TPD) that I want my watch to receive. This way I could leave the motor plugged into a battery 
                            and have it automatically rotate periodically.

                                Because I have a deep fascination with watches, and more watches than I can wear at once, I 
                                needed to create something that would keep my automatic watches accurate by making sure they 
                                are mechanical wound regularly. I programmed an Arduino to control a stepper motor that will 
                                wind a watch to make sure it holds its keeps time without me having to wind it every day.
                                I also learned how to use a 3D printer and CNC machine to create the base and watch holder 
                                apparatus.

                                My challenge for this week was to create a website from scratch that I could use to track 
                                my weekly projects for 2023. The main purpose of the website was so that I have a journal in 
                                a sense to record my planning and process for each new project and my reflection for how I can 
                                improve as an engineer going forward. First I decided how I wanted the website to look, then 
                                I wrote the HTML code and finally styled it with CSS. Once the website was created I filled 
                                in the content for my first two weeks of projects.

                                For the Global Formula Racing(GFR) Club that I am a volunteer for, I was tasked with 
                                modeling and creating a base that would be used to test battery cell connections with different
                                parameters. First I followed a tutorial to learn the basics of NX, a 3D modeling software.
                                Using what I learned from the tutorial, I designed and modeled the base to fit the battery
                                cells and the plates we will use to connect them. To create a physical model, I had to learn
                                how to use the milling machine. First I practiced using a block of aluminum, and then I
                                created the base with plastic to match my drawings.

                                To begin this project, I first created a technical drawing based on the dimensions and 
                                design I wanted to the box to have. I began by finding the kind of wood I wanted to use, 
                                then making it flat and square by using the wood planer and jointer. Next I cut the 
                                boards to the right size using the table saw and miter saw. Using wood glue and clamps, 
                                I assembled the box and let it dry. I then began the process of sanding and applying 
                                a clear coat of gloss finish before finally attaching the hinges and front clasp.
