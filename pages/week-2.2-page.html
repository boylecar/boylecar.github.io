                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the same reason as my previous few weeks of working on this project, my passion for watches and electronics 
                        has led me to try and create an automatic watch winder to recharge automatic watches by rotating them over time.
                        Last week I made the cylindrical watch holder out of wood that will house the watch itself, and the only steps necessary 
                        to create a functional first prototype for my project was to complete the watch box housing and assemble the 
                        electronics.

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        This week, my project was very straightforward and the finish line was very clearly within sight. I simply had to 
                        finish creating a cylindrical hole in the front of the watch winder, make some finishing touches on the cylinder with 
                        the lathe, and finally assemble the electronics with the motor and its driver, and the power switch and power supply.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        After making initial holes in the face of the watch winder box, I used the jigsaw to "connect" the holes and cut 
                        out the center of the large circle. Once I had a rough cutout of the shape of a circle, I used an oscillating sander 
                        to make the final refinements, making sure not to take off too much wood at any one time. After the cylinder would fit 
                        properly into the face of the box, I then began to assemble the electronics and backpiece of the box. I trimmed the wires 
                        so that they would not occupy much space inside the box, then connected my custom PCB to the motor driver, and the driver 
                        to the motor itself. Finally, I put the power supply wires in through the back of the box and connected it to the PCB. 
                        I finally assembled the back and attached the cylinder to it through the inside of the box.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                After many weeks of incremental progress and close to a full work week in total time spent indirectly on this project, 
                I was very nervous to plug it in for the first time. When I did, I was disappointed only for a moment to realize that 
                it did not function properly. As I had anticipated to be a potential problem, the watch cylinder made of walnut wood 
                was just too heavy for the small motor to turn. Although I very much wanted to complete this project, I knew 
                immediately that I had to solve the new problem that I was facing, of how to make the cylinder lighter. Although it 
                can be very discouraging to have something you worked hard for not work, I think it's important to always look at 
                what can be done now. As I move forward with this project, my challenge will to solve the problem of making the 
                watch housing cylinder lighter.
