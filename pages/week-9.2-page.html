                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to continue with this project by building the Program Counter Module, I continued to follow along with the instructions
                        and schematics provided by Ben Eater, an electronics educator. This module will simply act as 4-bit binary counter that will be implemented 
                        later to track the current step of the program being executed. To build this module, I only needed two IC chips. The 74LS161 itself is 
                        a binary counter which increments by 1 at the rising edge of each clock pulse. The outputs of this chip are put through a tristate 
                        buffer (74LS245) to control when it is driven to the bus.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Building this module was relatively simple as I have already used the tristate buffer chip before, and the binary counter chip was 
                        simple to use. At a fundamental level this chip uses flip-flops with its outputs tied to its inputs, and its clock signal tied to the 
                        output of the previous flip-flop hooked up in series. This will effectively cause the next-most significant bit to turn on when the one 
                        below it turns off, which is exactly how you would count in binary. The enable pin for this chip will be used later in the design of 
                        the CPU to decide when the program counter should increment or not. The value stored by this counter will represent 
                        the "step" of the current program, and increment after a step is completed.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                A few weeks ago when I was introduced to flip-flops and counters in my Digital Logic and Design class, I was entirely new to 
                the idea and implementation. After building a functioning register, I had a better understanding of the implementaion of flip-flops.
                Now after building the program counter and seeing yet another way that you can use this building block that is the flip-flop, I am very 
                satisfied to know that I am making progress towards my goal of understanding computers, and electronics more broadly, at a fundamental level.
                By seeing not just one but many distinctly different ways to use a flip-flop, I am beginning to become more familiar with its functionality 
                which allows me to be more creative in how I implement my knowledge.
