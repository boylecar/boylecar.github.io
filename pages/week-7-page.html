                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        While I had already created an effective automatic watch winder, there was still much to be desired 
                        in terms of the appearance and functionality of my design. Mainly, the Arduino I used to control the 
                        motor was unnecessarily large and included many unused components. My goal is always to do the best 
                        work I can, and it was clear that the way for me to most substantially improve my design was to simplify 
                        the microcontroller process. Building on my previous design, this week's goal was to:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Simplify the microcontroller process of my watch winder.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Initially, I performed some basic background research on how a microcontroller actually works and the different 
                        kinds of microcontrollers to get an idea of what this week's project would require. I decided to purchase a 
                        PIC microcontroller, mainly because of its programming abilities and the wide variety of support with them 
                        because of their popularity. I also purchased a PicKit4, the debugger that I would use to program the 
                        microcontroller, and a small breadboard to create the circuit on. The only step then would be to  
                        create a program that would be uploaded to the microcontroller.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        My first and most simple step was to create the circuit on the breadboard where I would attach my microcontroller. 
                        The next task was to learn to program the microcontroller with MPLABX, the software created by the manufacturer of 
                        the microcontroller, Microchip. After spending many hours watching tutorials about programming PIC microcontrollers, reading the Datasheet and 
                        every troubleshooting resource I could, and talking to several peers about their own microcontroller experience, 
                        I was still struggling to effectively upload my program and use my microcontroller. By starting from the top down, 
                        I deduced that my error must have been made in the program itself. After going through nearly every line of code 
                        in the program, many of which were inserted automatically by the software, I identified the one that was causing an 
                        error and removed it. Suddenly, my program worked exactly as I had intended. Initially, the output was only to turn on 
                        an LED, then to make it blink. After several iterations of my code and uploading it to test on my watch winder, I 
                        eventually created one that works exactly how I want.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                This week's project has been the most frustrating by far. I had previous experience programming an Arduino, 
                but programming a microcontroller with assembly language proved to be much more challenging than I could've 
                imagined. Some of the difficulty was simply due to tedious tasks and simple mistakes, but most of it was due 
                my sheer lack of experience with assembly language. I have never encountered any problem that works in any way 
                that is analogous to the way the registers in a microcontroller operate and execute actions. I'm glad that I 
                persisted and eventually reached the outcome I desired, but even more so that I was able to gain experience  
                programming microcontrollers so that I may use it for future projects. Causing an LED to blink with a 
                microcontroller is often referred to as the "Hello World" of microcontrollers, or basically the first notable 
                achievement in the long process of learning about a specific language or topic in programming/engineering. Once 
                I achieved this benchmark and passed the very frustrating initial threshold, I thoroughly enjoyed the process 
                of programming a microcontroller and seeing its actions begin to approach my intended design. This was by far the 
                most difficult project I've faced so far, but definitely the most rewarding.
