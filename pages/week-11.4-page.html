                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As this week will be my last week of school this year and therefore my last project, I wanted to make it one 
                        that is meaningful and personal. My mother has an old-fashioned record player that she has never been able to 
                        get working again. For my last project, my goal was straightforward:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Fix my mom's old-fashioned record player.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>

            <div class="middle">

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Turntables and record players that work consistently and effectively are very challenging to design and build, 
                        and would definitely be beyond the scope of a one-week project where I also need to integrate that turntable into 
                        a capable sound system. The main requirement for this project is that it's possible to put on a record and have 
                        it play through the speakers in the home audio station. The old turntable used acoustic amplification by actually 
                        capturing the sound wave directly from the needle, and sending it through a tube into the "amplifier" that worked 
                        by spinning a contraption very quickly, and forcing the sound waves to be amplified. The passive speakers were used 
                        completely independently for the AM/FM radio functions. The best solution was to replace the turntable with a new one, 
                        hook up the turntable to an audio amplifier, and put the output of the amplifier through the passive speakers.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once I had decided how I was actually going to solve this problem, the solution was relatively straightforward. 
                        At the store I had to pick out a record player with a preamp to produce a PHONO output, and a compatible amplifier 
                        that will take a PHONO input and be able to drive several low-impedance passive speakers. I also needed for the 
                        output of the amplifier to have general-purpose wire outputs as opposed to any kind of specific cable, so that 
                        I could use any of the copper wire I have at home. Finally, after purchasing the turntable and amplifier, connecting 
                        them together, and wiring the left and right output from the amplfiier to the two passive speakers, I was able 
                        to create a working system for my mom's old record player. To put the finishing touches on this project, I replaced 
                        the new turntable in the same place where the old one sat and covered up the missing space.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                As I conclude my final weekly project, I am filled with gratitude when I think about these experiences. I am thankful that 
                I had the idea in the first place to do something so bold and ambitious, and I am thankful that I was well-prepared by my parents to be
                consistent and relentless in my pursuit of the biggest goal I could imagine. All thanks to these simple projects, I have 
                earned a place in the best internship program I could imagine. I am proud of how far I have come, and I'm unbelievably excited for the next chapter of a 
                long and enjoyable career. At this point I am confident in my foundation and my ability to use what I know to solve 
                difficult problems in a short period of time with little to know prior knowledge. I know I have much to learn and that 
                learning will be a part of being an engineer, but I embrace that this will be an ongoing pursuit for the rest of my life.
                Going forward I will continue to do my best at everything I am involved in and push myself to keep getting better.
