                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        This week the CS 162 class in C++ that I tutor for has to complete their most difficult assignment of the term. 
                        Similar to the last few experiences involving my C++ programming, this week I wanted to complete this assignment
                        because I used Python when I took this class, and I think it is important for me to improve my C++ programming skills.
                        Therefore, my goal this week was pretty straightforward:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Finish Assignment 4 for C++, using Classes and polymorphism to create "Hunt the Wumpus"
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The design outline for this assignment required me to make a game that the user can play, where they "walk" through 
                        a cave system trying to find the hidden gold, and return to where they started. In the meantime, they have to avoid 
                        the hazards (bats and stalactites), as well as the Wumpus which will kill the player if they enter the same 
                        square as it. However, the player has 3 arrows they can use to try and shoot the wumpus, by using the clues they 
                        are given if the enter a square directly next to one of the hazards. Most of the functions required to run the game 
                        are a part of the Game class, and the hazards on the board inherit form the Event class.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To create this game, the Game class was used to store all information about the game, including the player's start position,
                        the player's current position, the number of rows and columns on the board, the location of the Wumpus, a bool value for 
                        whether or not the person has found the gold, etc. The most imporant of these is the 2D vector used to store the game board.
                        The 2D vector holds objects of the Room class. Each room has an Event* that is nullptr if the room is empty, or points to 
                        an event if it's not. Because all of the different objects on the board (bats, stalactites, Wumpus, gold) inheret from Event, 
                        the Event* in a Room object can point to an object of any one of these specific types. Many functions were required to 
                        move the player on the board, and perform the actions that are necessary when the player encounters one of the objects.

            <p> 
                This project is obviously very similar to my C++ pt. 3 project in terms of the skills that I developed by working on this project, so 
                naturally I will have gained similar insights. This week it became even more clear to me just how much it is helping me as an engineer 
                overall to become a better programmer. Not only does it make me better at programming specifically, but I think it does 
                an incredible job of helping me train the part of my brain responsible for solving problems from the fundamentals, and first 
                principles reasoning, which may well be the defining characteristic of a good engineer. I think that continuing to become 
                a better programmer will be worth the investment in the long run and it is something I plan to continue working on moving 
                forward.
