                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I believe that reflection is a critical aspect of both being a good engineer and living a good life in 
                        general. For nearly every project I create or discipline I pursue, I reflect on my actions and the 
                        results of the experience. Naturally, I asked myself how I was going to track my progress with my weekly 
                        projects and reflect on them when I finish each. Eventually, I had the idea to create a website from 
                        scratch where I could keep a record of my projects both for myself and as a project portfolio for 
                        potential employers to see what experience I have. So, my objective for this week was:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Create a website to track my planning, process, and reflection for each weekly project.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Similar to my last project, this week's project would not benefit from an immense amount of planning, 
                        and was instead more focused on the process of solving small problems along the way toward my objective.
                        However, it was very helpful to draw just a simple sketch on paper of how I wanted the website to appear 
                        before I even started coding it. Because I used flexbox for most of the styling of the website, a clear 
                        drawing ahead of time helped me visualize specifically if a flexbox would be horizontal or vertical 
                        and which ones would be contained in larger boxes. Along the way, I primarily used Google to quickly find 
                        solutions to problems I encountered or when I wasn't sure how to approach an issue. I used VSCode to edit 
                        the code for the website, and GitHub to store each iteration as I made major changes to the site along 
                        the way.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        When I began this project, I substantially underestimated the time it would take to complete the 
                        outcome I was after, but slightly overestimated how difficult it would be. While it took many hours of 
                        solving small issues (mostly formatting with CSS), there was no single problem that was too difficult 
                        to be broken down simply and solved. As I mentioned, the most time-consuming and difficult part was 
                        trying to visualize how to divide each section of the website into flexbox parents and children. The best 
                        way I found to do this was to apply a border first to a parent flexbox to make sure it was the size I 
                        wanted. Next, I would decide what would be the child elements and put borders on them too, once again 
                        ensuring that the padding, spacing between elements, and flex-grow and flex-shrink properties were all 
                        correct. In addition to the low-level problem-solving required to achieve the desired appearance, it was 
                        also difficult to make high-level decisions about the website and how it should look. For example, in many 
                        ways it's easier to make all the boxes square and change their color or size, and much harder to decide 
                        if the website would look better if all the elements were square, all rounded, or perhaps a mix of both.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Initially, when I was learning web development, I wasn't overly excited or interested. However, once I took a more 
                active approach by creating a website of my own instead of only completing learning objectives assigned by the 
                courses I was taking, web development became much more exciting. I enjoyed solving the small problems 
                along the way and seeing the website slowly come together. Also, while I mentioned it was difficult to make high-level 
                decisions about the appearance of the website as a whole, I learned to appreciate this aspect of the 
                web development process when I get to challenge myself creatively. In this way, this project opened my eyes more 
                than anything else to the fact that engineering is not <em>only</em> about the technical aspect of creation, but 
                just as much about its <em>purpose</em> and how it's perceived or used by the intended audience or customer. I 
                learned that as an engineer I will obviously have to solve technical problems, but I will also have to make 
                decisions about appearance based on how to optimize the product for its purpose. In this case, my website had 
                to be functional but also easy to read and navigate for potential employers.
