                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:
                    </p>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        This week I will install the final hardware to complete my computer. This week I learned about what it means for a 
                        computer to be "computationally complete." Formally, this means that the computer can compute anything that a 
                        Turing Machine can compute. This is an entirely too large of a topic to describe fully, but it is important to know 
                        that the only thing missing for my computer to be Turing complete is the ability to perform if, then operations. To do 
                        this, I build a Flags Register that will store data when a specific signal goes HIGH. The signals I will use are both 
                        derived from the ALU. The first flag is the Zero Flag which is raised when the value in the ALU is zero. The second flag is 
                        the Carry Flag, which goes HIGH when the ALU has a carry-out bit. Both of these will be driven as inputs to the EEPROM, and 
                        used in if, then statements. For example, I could perform subtraction between the A and B register. If A and B are equal, the 
                        value stored in the ALU is zero and the Zero Flag is raised. I can use this to represent the expression: "if A == 5:  "

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To implement the Flags Register, I use the same flip-flop chip that I have used for previous modules to store the values of 
                        the Carry and Zero Flags into the Flags register. The enable signal which updates the values stored in this register is 
                        also implemented into the CPU, so that during a program it can store the state of the Flags into the Flags Register. On 
                        the next step of the program, it could use these values and do something different depending on the different states of the Flags.
                        This essentially creates a feedback loop, where the output of a program is fed back into the input of the CPU which executes 
                        the program itself. Finally, I will reprogram the EEPROM's to account for these inputs.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                This week I learned a significant amount about the Flags register and how that can be used to write conditional expressions,
                but what I enjoyed learning most was about the philosophical idea of "computational completeness" and what a Turing 
                Machine is. It's very interesting to me to learn about the history of electronics, computers, math, and other similar topics,
                and seeing how these high-level concepts apply to the physical things that I'm building. Now that I have installed all the 
                hardware for this computer, I'm very excited to be able to learn more about Assembly Language and microcode when learning to 
                make more advanced programs next week.
