                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the same reason as my first two weeks working on this project, I wanted to create and optimize an 
                        automatic watch winder that I can use in my everyday life to charge an automatic watch if it loses power.
                        I have had a passion for watches ever since I was a young kid, and as my collection has grown over time I have 
                        began to face the problem of keeping them all running. This provided the opportunity for me to create a 
                        mechanism that would wind the watches with the force of gravity by rotating the watch and gradually 
                        winding the mainspring. Building off last week's design, my big-picture goal this week is to:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Optimize an automatic watch winder
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To add onto last week's iteration of my project, it is clear that the biggest improvement that should 
                        be made is in terms of the design's simplicity. Using an Arduino to control the motor was the only 
                        feasible solution I had access to in previous weeks, however it is not optimized for my project because 
                        the amount of unused components that make up the Arduino. Essentiallly the only components of the Arduino 
                        that I'm actually using is the microcontroller and the GPIO pins. The next logical improvement then is 
                        to design a system using only a microcontroller that replaces the Arduino. For this I would need to purchase 
                        a microcontroller which are very cheap, and a device to program it with. After researching I decided 
                        that a PIC microcontroller would be the best option for my project. I would need to learn some basic 
                        Assembly Language to create a program for the micrcontroller and use a compiler to actually tell the 
                        microcontroller what to do. I will simply attach the microcontroller to a breadboard and then to the 
                        pins for the motor to activate it.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The process of creating the 3D model of the part was simple and only took a few hours after I was given 
                        the dimensions that would accomodate the battery cells. I also modeled the metal plate that would secure the 
                        battery cells but have to wait for the materials to create it with. When I had the opportunity to learn 
                        how to use the milling machine, I spent several hours learning the fundamentals and practiced drilling 
                        holes and fitting each sides to the correct dimensions. The product of my tutorial is the aluminum block 
                        in the pictures to the left and above. After I understood how to use the machine, it was relatively quick 
                        to cut the plastic with a band saw, square and flatten the base with the milling machine, then make cuts 
                        to set the 
                        block to be the correct dimensions. Finally, I drilled the holes in the correct locations and at the right 
                        depth, so that I could attach the plates with screws later. The final step after drilling the holes was 
                        to tap them to the right size to create the threading for the screws. The most difficult parts of 
                        the entire process were learning how to use the machine and accomodating the tediousness of the tiny 
                        tolerances.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                My second project of this year, although much more simple than the first, was just as valuable in terms of how 
                much I was able to take away about what it's like to be an engineer. I did a much better job with this project 
                on planning and thinking through potential future problems before I actually began creating the physical model. 
                While the planning process isn't quite as exciting, I continue to learn to appreciate this part of the process as 
                necessary for producing a high-quality outcome. I also find significant enjoyment in the process of learning 
                new skills, like 3D modeling with NX for this project and even more so the milling machine. This project made me 
                realize that I enjoy the process of building/assembling the product and working with physical parts 
                more than anything. This experience also helped grow my patience and attention to detail by requiring me to 
                go very slow and be precise when making measurements that need to be accurate to within .0005 inches. Although 
                this project was more skill-focused than it was outcome-focused, I am beyond satisfied with the lessons I 
                learned and the outcome produced.
