                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the same reason as my last two projects, I chose this project because of my fascination with watches.
                        Over my last break from school, I purchased a kit that instructs you on how to disassemble and 
                        reassemble a mechanical watch movement. My purpose with this project was to gain an understanding of  
                        watch mechanisms on a more fundamental level, understanding the different components that work together 
                        to create a functioning movement. Since I finally had an opportunity to build the watch movement, 
                        my goal for this week's project was:

                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Disassemble and reassemble an automatic watch movement to understand its components and their relationship.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Because the instructions for building the watch movement were included in the kit, my planning for this 
                        week's project was very straightforward, requiring little extra planning besides just following the directions
                        given to me by the instruction guide. Before actually beginning the process of building the movement, I 
                        only needed to find a large empty table and set up an overhead light. I also had to wear gloves in order 
                        to ensure that I didn't get dust on the watch movements. Because they are so small and precise, even dust can 
                        negatively affect the accuracy of a movement.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Following the instruction manual carefully, I began by de-energizing the mainspring, removing the 
                        stored potential energy by removing the tension from the mainspring. Next, I began removing the components 
                        in the order I was instructed to, beginning with the minute and hour hands, then the driver canon pinion 
                        which attaches to the hour hand. After that, I removed the balance wheel, the part you can see oscillating back 
                        and forth because of the palette fork and the escape wheel. I also removed the center wheel, which powers the minute hand with 
                        the mainspring stored in the barrel. Additionally, I had to remove various gears throughout the process 
                        that transfer energy to different parts of the movement. The final steps were to remove the stem, the part 
                        of the watch you rotate to wind it and set the time, and the winding and sliding pinion with interlock with 
                        each other to allow you to engage and disengage the stem from the mainspring. The most important systems 
                        that encompass what is needed to build a watch are the escapement, keyless works, and gear train. The 
                        escapement mechanism is what delivers power to the gears at a consistent rate, preventing the mainspring 
                        from dissipating power too slowly or quickly. The keyless works system includes all the components that allow to engage 
                        and disengage the stem from the mainspring. Finally, the gear train simply refers to all of the gears that 
                        work to deliver energy to the pinions and hands, ensuring that the minute hand rotates 12 times per every 
                        rotation of the hour hand.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Initially, my plan for this week's project was to continue my project from the last two weeks, my automatic watch 
                winder. This week I purchased a microcontroller and a programmer for it so I could program it to perform the simple 
                tasks I needed without all the unnecessary components that an Arduino uses. After spending close to 20 hours 
                learning about microcontrollers and how they work, and trying to program my own, I was still no closer to solving the 
                errors I kept getting. Because I wanted to keep on track to complete one project every week, I knew I would 
                have to cut this project off early and work on something I knew I could complete. I wish I was able to finish my 
                original plan, but I also learned a valuable lesson that while learning a completely new skill, I can't spend forever
                on a project without getting anywhere. I think it's important to struggle and not give up too soon, but at a 
                certain point, you begin to waste your time. Because of this, I switched to a different project where I genuinely
                learned a lot about a different subject I was interested in. Eventually, when I have a better understanding of 
                microcontrollers, I'm confident I will be able to come back to this project and find a solution.
