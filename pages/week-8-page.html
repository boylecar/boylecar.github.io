                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the same reason as my previous few weeks of working on this project, my passion for watches and electronics 
                        has led me to try and create an automatic watch winder to recharge automatic watches by rotating them over time.
                        After last week's iterations it's clear that my design will work how I want. However, I wanted to improve my 
                        design by making it more simple and reducing the physical size and complication of the circuit built on the 
                        breadboard. The best way to do this that is implemented in nearly all modern electronics is a Printed Circuit 
                        Board(PCB). My goal for this week's project was to:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Create a functioning PCB to control and power my automatic watch winder.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Because I am entirely new to PCB design, the first step in accomplishing this week's project was to decide which 
                        PCB design software I was going to use. It seemed that the best free program to use for beginners is KiCad. My 
                        next steps would be to learn the fundamentals of KiCad and how to use the program to create schematics, convert 
                        those schematics into a PCB layout, and export that design to a manufacturer for production. These steps are 
                        pretty straightforward, but actually completing them will prove to be difficult due to my lack of any prior 
                        knowledge of PCB design and manufacturing.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I initially spent multiple hours watching different tutorials and using other online resources to familiarize myself 
                        with KiCad while following along on my own computer. At a fundamental level I now understand the steps necessary 
                        to create a functional PCB. First, you must create symbols for your circuit components that you will use in a 
                        circuit schematic. The schematic outlines the connections needed to create the functioning circuit you're designing. 
                        Once you have created a schematic, the next step is to create footprints for each of your components. The footprint 
                        is the actual physical space needed to solder a given component onto the PCB later on. Once you have finished all the 
                        steps up to this point, you must now arrange the components in a way that allows no two wires to cross over each other. 
                        If the circuit is complicated enough, this may require several vertical layers of wiring for the wires to travel through 
                        to avoid crossing. Once the PCB is designed, the final step is to export the gerber files and send them to a PCB manufacturer 
                        to be produced.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Initially, it was very difficult to get a handle on how to create an effective PCB using the KiCad software. However, 
                I did realize that my ability to pick up new skills quickly is improving after having learned so many distinctly new 
                skills these past few weeks. After slowing down and looking at the the PCB design process from a higher perspective, 
                it made it much easier to see that what seemed like a bunch of unrelated steps was really a logical and ordered 
                set of steps that are not difficult to follow. After receiving the PCB in the mail I realized that I made a slight mistake 
                while designing it by making some of the components to be surface mount components, however, thankfully this will not be a 
                big enough error to have to redo the entire PCB. This is a good lesson, however, to not only use regular mounting for use 
                with solder when I am designing a PCB, but more broadly to make sure I have a fundamental understanding of what I am doing 
                rather than just rushing through. I think that I could have avoided this mistake if I were to spend more time during the 
                learning process, and that is something I would like to practice more moving forward.
