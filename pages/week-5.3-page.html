                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            FINISH building a simple computer by understanding its components at a fundamental level.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The final step needed to make this computer functional was to create instructions that the computer would use to 
                        execute multiple steps. For example, the ADD instruction that I wrote executes a series of microinstructions to take 
                        the contents of a location in memory, add it to the value in the A register, and store that new value in the A register.
                        The first microinstruction of every instruction is to load the contents of the program counter into memory, so the 
                        computer knows which instruction to perform. First I will need to program the EEPROM's with the information of what signals to set 
                        and when. Then when the computer is on, I will "program" the machine code into RAM and execute the program.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As shown in the first image above, I created many unique instructions that the CPU will be able to interpret 
                        and set the signals to the correct state with proper timing. The number associated with the Assembly language 
                        code is arbitrary, as long as I remember which instruction code corresponds to which instruction programmed on 
                        the EEPROM CPU. For example, when the CPU receives the instruction code: 1110, it knows to start the sequence of 
                        microinstructions that will cause the output register to display what is stored in the A register on the hex display.
                        Or when the CPU receives the instruction: 0110, it will "jump" to the address location that is specified. Using these 
                        commands, I first wrote a program that will count up to 255 and back down again. I also wrote a program that calculates 
                        Fibonacci numbers and stops at 233, as well as a program that can multiply two numbers.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                As I have finally reached the end of this project, it's very surreal to sit back and look at how far I have come in just a 
                few short weeks. Before I began this project, I had almost no idea how computers worked at any level, but now I have built each 
                module of a functioning computer piece by piece from just IC chips, resistors, capacitors, LED's, buttons, and swithces. Using 
                these few components, I have built something much more complex that resembles how modern computers work at a fundamental level. There 
                is a vastly large gap between the capabilities of this computer and any modern computer, but the amount that I have learned from this 
                project is invaluable. I'm very excited to see what I can do with my new understanding moving forward and what projects I will be able to build with this project as my foundational understanding.
