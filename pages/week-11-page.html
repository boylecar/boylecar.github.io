                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the same reason as my previous few weeks of working on this project, my passion for watches and electronics 
                        has led me to try and create an automatic watch winder to recharge automatic watches by rotating them over time.
                        Last week I made modifications to the box to account for a power input and switch, and it seemed clear that 
                        next logical step for my project was to create the watch holder that houses the watch pillow where I 
                        will put my watch. For this I will have to get to learn to use a lathe, which will allow me to make 
                        other different projects in the future.

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        My first step this week in order to build the piece that I wanted was to learn how to use a lathe.
                        To do this I would watch tutorial videos on youtube and talk to my dad and uncle who both have 
                        experience with woodworking. After learning how to use the machine, I would practice turning a 
                        scrap piece of wood with the same material to make sure I understand how much I can cut off at once. 
                        After that I would mount the piece that will make my finished project to the lathe and begin to rough 
                        out the edges. Once the cylinder is of a consistent diameter, I can make the edge cuts at the right 
                        place to make the bottom of the cylinder smaller and able to fit into the front of the box.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I found several youtube videos that were very helpful and explained clearly the purpose of a lathe and 
                        the basics of its operation. Specifically I learned how to mount the wood to the lathe and about 
                        when to use which cutting tool. In the beginning I would use the roughing gauge to take off a relatively 
                        large amount of wood at a time, and as I got closer to the desired shape I would use a more precise tool. 
                        After testing on a piece of scrap wood, I mounted the wood to a smaller piece of wood which attached 
                        easier to the lathe. I turned the lathe on and then slowly made cuts until I had reached a 
                        completely round circle. Then I switched to a sharper tool to make a precise cut where I would 
                        make a groove so that the front of the piece would stick out past the hole that it is set in. Once I 
                        had finished sanding the piece, I began to use the jigsaw to cut a hole in the front of the box for the 
                        cylinder.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Although I wasn't able to completely finish my watch winder project by the end of this term as I had planned, 
                I am still overwhelmingly satisfied with the progress of my project as a whole. In just one term of school I have 
                been able to learn a large number of new skills and apply them through planning, execution, and reflection in 
                11 different small projects, many of which contributed to my Automatic Watch Winder project. This makes me reflect 
                on one of the things I have learned more than anything else through this experience, that almost everything 
                takes longer than you expect it to. During my planning I often don't account for small mistakes or errors, and 
                I don't end up accounting for enough time to finish my projects. As I move forward next term to continue working on 
                my Automatic Watch Winder and other new projects, I want to improve in this way by planning for things to take longer. 
                This way I can take my time with my projects and not rush through them. As I near the finish line with my project I 
                am very excited to see the finished project working on its own for the first time.
