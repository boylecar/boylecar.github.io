                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As we learn more and more about electronic components and the kinds of circuits that we can build in my Junior-level 
                        classes, I become more and more excited about the career that I chose. For our final project for my Junior Design 
                        class, we designed a voltage oscillator using opamps. This circuit is the most interesting that we have been able 
                        to design in this class, so for this reason I chose to include it as my project for this week.

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        From a high level, this circuit works by taking advantage of the fact that it takes tiem to charge and discharge a 
                        capacitor, as well as the ability to use opamps with feedback to have the output follow its non-inverting input. 
                        By connecting multiple opamps in series, each with their own RC circuit, you create a series of circuits that 
                        will have similiar wave forms on their output, but each be out of phase from one another.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        At each of the opamps in this circuit with its output connected to the inverting input, the output of the opamp 
                        will follow the voltage at the non-inverting pin, due to the behavior of an opamp. When the voltage on the output 
                        rises, the voltage on the non-inverting input of the next opamp starts to rise determined by the rate set by 
                        the RC relationship. This is what causes the next wave to be slightly out of phase. This pattern continues, further 
                        shifiting the wave form and decreasing its magnitude from losses in the resistors, until finally the waveform 
                        reaches the primary opamp circuit, which has been set to a specific gain to account for the losses from the other opamps.
                        Once the circuit is disturbed from its initial state, the outputs of the opamps will continue to oscillate indefinitely.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                This week's project, although pretty straightforward, was just as interesting and educational as the others. I think that the best thing 
                I can do for myself to gain experience with electronics and get better over time is to see circuits that others have made, 
                learn why they made the design decisions that they did, and gain more of an intuition for circuit design. As I approach 
                the end of this year, I am so proud to look back on how far I have come and how much I have learned. When I first started 
                these weekly projects I questioned whether or not it would have any real benefit or I was just wasting my time. I took a 
                risk by doing something this unique, but now I realize it was worth absolutely every minute.
