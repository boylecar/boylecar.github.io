                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The biggest reason I chose to study engineering was so that I could use my knowledge and problem-solving 
                        skills to contribute to society in a significant way and add value with my work. One potential path I am 
                        interested in pursuing is the production of electric cars. I think a future where electric cars have 
                        been maximized for performance and make our society more sustainable is a better, more exciting one. The 
                        Global Formula Racing(GFR) Club at Oregon State University works on this exact problem: building an 
                        electric car and maximizing its performance. Naturally, I got involved as much as I could contribute. 
                        The problem for this week that was assigned to me was:

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Although my project this week was certainly not easy, it was relatively simple and therefore didn't 
                        require much planning in advance. I spent roughly 5 hours per week my first term learning the basics 
                        of 3D modeling with NX, so I was already familiar with the process of creating the design. After that I 
                        needed to learn how to create technical drawings with the NX software. Next I would  
                        learn how to actually create a physical model of the base using a milling machine. Finally, 
                        I would create the actual physical design according to the dimensions of the technical drawing.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The process of creating the 3D model of the part was simple and only took a few hours after I was given 
                        the dimensions that would accomodate the battery cells. I also modeled the metal plate that would secure the 
                        battery cells but have to wait for the materials to create it with. When I had the opportunity to learn 
                        how to use the milling machine, I spent several hours learning the fundamentals and practiced drilling 
                        holes and fitting each sides to the correct dimensions. The product of my tutorial is the aluminum block 
                        in the pictures to the left and above. After I understood how to use the machine, it was relatively quick 
                        to cut the plastic with a band saw, square and flatten the base with the milling machine, then make cuts 
                        to set the 
                        block to be the correct dimensions. Finally, I drilled the holes in the correct locations and at the right 
                        depth, so that I could attach the plates with screws later. The final step after drilling the holes was 
                        to tap them to the right size to create the threading for the screws. The most difficult parts of 
                        the entire process were learning how to use the machine and accomodating the tediousness of the tiny 
                        tolerances.
