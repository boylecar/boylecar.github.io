                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Continue building a simple computer by understanding its components at a fundamental level.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Now that my computer is starting to come together, the next piece that would be important is to make it possible 
                        to output user-friendly information so that it doesn't require specialized knowledge of each peace to understand. To do this,
                        I will use four 7-segment decimal displays. Three of them will be used to represent a value up to 255, and the fourth will 
                        represent a positive or negative sign value. In order to do build the logic needed to control the values for 
                        each of the segments of the display for each value, I will use a ROM chip to replace combinational logic. This week, I will 
                        build a robust EEPROM programmer using an Arduino Nano, so that I can simply upload a program to the Arduino that will 
                        change the information stored in the EEPROM.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to achieve the effect that I want where some 8-bit input will be interpreted by the EEPROM to output the 
                        decoded values for the individual segments of the 4 displays, I will essentially be programming the output values 
                        into the memory of the EEPROM, stored at the address that is specified by the inputs. For example, if 142 should be 
                        interpreted by the EEPROM and output a binary value of 11000101, then I will program the EEPROM to have the value 
                        11000101 at the address 142. Because the Arduino doesn't have enough pins for all 11 inputs and 8 outputs, however, 
                        I will build an 8-bit shift register with two IC chips that will be used to set the value at the register specified by the Arduino.
                        In practice, the Arduino will shift out 8 bits of information, set the 11 address pins to the correct value, and enable 
                        the EEPROM to reprogram. Next week, I can use this EEPROM to replace the combinational logic needed in the output register 
                        of my computer.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Working on building a way to program the EEPROM this week has been one of the most exciting projects yet for the simple fact 
                that I was able to implement a few different skills that I currently have in addition to new knowledge to build something useful.
                Programming an Arduino was one of the first things that I learned how to do as an Electrical Engineer, so it is very rewarding to 
                reflect on how far I have come and how much knowledge I am able to apply to a new challenge that only 6 months ago I would've had 
                no idea how to approach. As I continue to gain more skills moving forward, I'm very excited to see how I can use my current knowledge as a tool 
                to solve new and different challenges.
