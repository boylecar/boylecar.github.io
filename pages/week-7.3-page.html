                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In my Introdcution to Computer Science class (CS 162), our final project for the course was to build a variation 
                        of the classic game of Chess. In this version, all pieces moved the same but the starting position of the pieces 
                        is the one shown to the left. However, you are not allowed to make a move that puts the opposing player's king 
                        in check, nor your own king in check. The purpose of the game is instead to get your king to row 8 of the board. This 
                        was an appropriate challenge for my current skill level with programming in Python, but after finishing the project 
                        I felt I could learn a lot from challenging myself to build a full working Chess game with Python. Therefore, 
                        my goal this week was to:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To start this project, there were a few significant challenges that I could forsee before even beginning. 
                        Firstly, I would need to find a way to represent each of the pieces with unique properties, and use some kind of 
                        object to represent their positions on the board. The greatest challenge for this project would definitely be to 
                        determine if a move is allowed or not. This is especially difficult because of how many checks need to be done for 
                        each piece attempting to move. Finally, I would have to account for special cases like En Passant, Castling, 
                        promoting a Pawn, Stalemate, and Checkmate.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To start this project I create a class of objects called Pieces that would represent the individual pieces on the 
                        board containing information like the piece's name, color, ASCII symbol, and number of moves made. I also defined a 
                        unique class for each piece that inherits from the Pieces class and initializes the variables with the correct values.
                        I then defined a ChessVar class that is used to represent the chess game. This class has internal variables for each 
                        piece on the board, which is represented by a dictionary containing 8 lists as the keys to correspond to the 8 columns on 
                        the chess board. It also has useful variables to track the state of the game (check, unfinished, stalemate, etc.), the turn 
                        number, and stats about whether or not someone is attempting a "special" move (en passant, castle, promotion). The class has 
                        several methods but the two most important are the make_move() method which calls the verify_move() method. These two work
                        together to ensure that a move is legal and update the board accordingly if it is.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Having completed this project I am very satisfied with my work overall. During this class and especially with this project 
                I learned that I very much enjoy the process of writing a program. I looked forward to the projects for this class more than 
                any of my other classes by far. For this reason, I would essentially dedicate an entire day to work for this class, and try 
                to finish my other assignments on other days. I love the feeling I got every week sitting down in the morning having no idea 
                how I'm going to complete the project this week but knowing that by the end of the day I will have figured it out. That 
                process of struggling towards a solution is something I have fallen in love with during this class.
