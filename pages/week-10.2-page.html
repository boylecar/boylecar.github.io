                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Usually I only reflect on the personal projects that I complete, but for this week I wanted to analyze a 
                        project that I have completed for my ENGR 103 class using Embedded Systems, microcontrollers, and C programming. As 
                        this is the first significant project that I have done that is related to my future career plans, I thought that it 
                        was important to document and record my progress for looking back on at a later date. The goal for this project assigned 
                        by my professor was:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Use an embedded system to record, analyze, and summarize data over a 24-hour period.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Out of the choices that we had for parameters to measure, I chose to look at temperature over a 24-hour period in 
                        my apartment. To make this possible I used a thermistor which is just a variable resistor that changes with temperature. 
                        By measuring the resistance of the thermistor with a microcontroller, I could determine the temperature as specified by 
                        the datasheet for the thermistor. I could then record this temperature by printing it to the serial monitor where I 
                        could have a Python script read from and record the data into a .csv file, and create a graph of the temperature over 
                        time. Another requirement of this assignment was to have a 10-minute rolling average, which is the value that I would graph 
                        for a specific time. After 24 hours, I would have a graph that I could use to analyze MAX, MIN, and AVG temperatures.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To construct the hardware needed for this project, I needed only to create a voltage divider with a known voltage source 
                        and resistor. By measuring the difference between GND and the voltage across the thermistor, I could calculate its resistance. 
                        Based on the bands given by the datasheet for temperature and the correlated resistance, I wrote a function that returned the 
                        temperature in degrees based on which region the resistance falls into. Every second, the program will measure the voltage, calculate 
                        resistance, convert to temperature, and print that temperature. It will also update an array of size 600 (600 seconds in 10 minutes) with 
                        the current temperature and calculate the average temperature of the last 10 minutes. Finally, it will calculate the new rolling 
                        average from the current average, the current temperature, and the total amount of data points used to calculate the current average. All 
                        of this is printed and read by a Python script that records the data and returns a graph of the data over time.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                The most interesting part about this project and the class for me was learning about how much potential there is for computers.
                I had always had the impression that computers were "limited" to personal use for school, work or similar. But being able 
                to program my own embedded system that functions without any user input and returns valuable information collected exclusively 
                from sensors is something very useful that I would like to do more with in the future. For example, systems like this that take 
                no user input and run completely based on sensors can be used automate important things like electric cars. As this is an area that 
                is of high interest for me in my career, getting even just a small glimpse into the kind of work that I could be doing was very 
                exciting.
