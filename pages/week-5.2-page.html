                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:
                    </p>

                        <strong><em>
                            Continue building a simple computer by understanding its components at a fundamental level.
                        </em></strong>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to continue with this project by building the 8-bit registers, I needed only to follow the instructions
                        provided and follow along with the instructional videos for this project by Ben Eater, an electrical engineering 
                        educator online. My process would be to first watch the videos to get a broad overview of the building process and 
                        learn about how the different components work together, then assemble the project on my own using the high level 
                        circuit diagram for the registers and looking at the datasheets for the individual chips. Finally, once I have 
                        built the module and made sure that it works, I will rewatch the instructional videos to solidify my understanding 
                        of how the register functions at a fundamental level.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        At a fundamental level, an 8-bit register is made from 8 D-flip-flops. On the rising edge of each clock signal, a 
                        D-flip-flop will update its output based on its input and store that value in "memory." By wiring 8 of these 
                        flip flops in parallel, you create a register. With a control pin, you can select whether the flip-flop will read 
                        the input and push it to its outputs or if it will keep its previous state. By connecting the output of these 
                        registers through LED's, it's easy to see visually the data stored in the register. Additionally, the output of the 
                        register is put through a tristate buffer, which allows data to flow only when its enable pin is HIGH. From there, the 
                        data is output onto the common bus whenever the enable pin is HIGH. With the CLK, Read, and Enable pins, you have 
                        control over the register and it can be effectively implemented with the rest of the computer.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Being very similar to my first week working on this project, it was very exciting to be working with electronics 
                in a meaningful way and seeing a functioning computer come together. It's so interesting to me to see how all of 
                the components work together at a fundamental level to create something meaningful. Working on a project like this 
                also makes me really appreciate the ingenuity of the electrical engineers who first used electronics to build 
                computers in a much more sophisticated way than I am even still. This project has also given me even further 
                reassurance that a career in electrical engineering is what I want, because of how much I enjoy the entire 
                process from start to finish of building a project like this. Even after a long week of many hours of classes,
                homework, and tests, it was still exciting to be doing real work on a project like this.
