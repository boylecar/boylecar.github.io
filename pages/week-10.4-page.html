                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        From my coursework alone, I have not gained much knowledge about RF or high-frequency digital circuits and their 
                        unique properties. Soon I will be starting an internship where much of the electronics are heavily dependent on 
                        this kind of knowledge, and so I want to gain a better foundation that what I have currently. I've always wanted 
                        to get a HAM radio license as well, so this week I decided that my goal would be to:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Study and pass the test to receive a HAM radio license.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are many online or physical textbook options that prepare you for the HAM radio test, but I decided to use
                        hamstudy.org as it provides exact questions that will be on the test and is very simple to use. To prepare and learn 
                        as much as possible as best I can, I would go through the "study mode" where I would be presented with one question 
                        at a time and be able to get immediate feedback about whether my answer was correct or not. If I didn't understand 
                        a concept in the question, I would research it so that I would be able to answer the question again next time.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        During this process of studying for the HAM radio test, I definitely learned a lot of new things about different 
                        frequency bands and their most common purposes. All of the questions related to DC electric circuits and electronic 
                        components were naturally very easy for me after the coursework I've taken. However, the questions related to 
                        wave propagation, polarization, and the atmospheric effects on radio waves were very new to me and extremely 
                        informative once I was able to research these topics in more depth. I took the test in front of a group of 
                        proctors over zoom on a Saturday evening, and found out immediately that I had passed. A few weeks later I was 
                        informed of my call sign: KK7RUA

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                This week's project was unique in that I really did not "build" any project, but I definitely think that it was just as 
                informative as many of my other weekly projects. I was forced to learn some concepts that used to seem very foreign to me in 
                order to succeed on this test, and so therefore learned a lot. I'm excited to have gained a new skill and it feels good to 
                receive a certificate indicating the completeness of my competence with the subject, regardless of how much I know I still 
                have to learn on the related subjects. All of the RF-related topics I have studied have always been very interesting, so I 
                plan to pursue more of these kinds of topics on my coursework and career moving forward.
