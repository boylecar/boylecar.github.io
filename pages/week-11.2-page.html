                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the same reason as last week's project, this project felt like a critical point in my growth as an engineer and 
                        for this reason I decided to document it here. In my Digital Logic and Design class, ECE 271, we have done several 
                        projects that have allowed me to practice designing digital logic circuits. I have really enjoyed this process, and 
                        because of the difficulty of this project, I think it is important to recognize how much I have learned and how much 
                        room I still have to grow. The task assigned by my professor was:

                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        There were a few options that we could select for inputs and outputs for this project, and I chose to take on the 
                        most difficult of these. The most difficult input to look at was an Infrared (IR) signal from a TV remote or similar. 
                        The output I chose to use was moving a sprite on a VGA display. Building the IR decoder was difficult as the timing 
                        had to be very precise, as well as the fact that the message received needed to be verified before causing a change 
                        in the output, otherwise IR noise from sources other than the remote could cause a change in the output. The system that 
                        I wanted to simulate with this project was the function of changing the volume up or down on a TV. At a high level, this 
                        required an IR decoder module, a state machine to interpret the IR signal and set the volume level, and output logic 
                        that would output the current volume level onto the VGA display.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since IR data from a remote is encoded in binary, he IR decoder functions primarily with a counter that will count the 
                        amount of time since the last rising edge of the Data signal. Using a series of comparators, you can determine if the value was a 
                        logic 1 or 0 based on how long the pulse was. After the initiation sequence is detected, a shift register will push the values interpreted 
                        by the IR sensor into an internal shift register. Once the closing sequence is detected, verification is performed on this sequence to 
                        make sure that it is a proper sequence and not one that was misread. If it is a good input, it is decoded based on which input was 
                        pushed. For example, if the UP button was pushed on the remote, the IR decoder will perform all the steps described and tell the 
                        state machine to increment the current state by 1. The VGA display works by choosing to display the background color or the color of an 
                        image file stored in memory as it sweeps through columns and rows to display an image.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                This project is the most technically-involved one that I have completed so far and although there are many imperfections and 
                inefficiencies in my design, I'm very happy with how it turned out overall and I'm excited to see what I can do with an IR 
                decoder in future projects. As I do more engineering projects, gain more skills and therefore more confidence in my ability 
                to solve problems, I learn to appreciate the process of problem-solving more and more. It used to be very uncomfortable to 
                start a project and have no idea how I was going to come to a solution. Although today it still uncomfortable, I have become 
                more familiar with that uncomfortability. Because I have the confidence in myself to know that I can finish the project at 
                hand, I have learned to love the process of problem-solving and using the tools I have to approach a solution. I cannot overstate 
                how much this project and class has solidified my desire to pursue a career as an electrical engineer.
