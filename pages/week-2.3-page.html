                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        This week I will implement the EEPROM's that I programmed last week to drive the display for the four 7-segment 
                        displays that will act as the output of my computer. The intention behind this display is that it will offer a way 
                        for someone using the computer to have a meaningful interaction with it without having to understand encoded signals 
                        or the LED's for the binary registers. Instead, it is much more user-friendly to simply view a decimal number. To achieve
                        this, a clock and multiplexer will choose the correct number to display on the correct decimal display at the correct time.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to avoid needing 4 separate EEPROM's for the 4 different displays, I will instead program the EEPROM to store 
                        the information for the 4 decimal places and very quickly cycle through each display, outputting the correct value for each display.
                        Using a 555 timer, I built a similar clock module to the primary clock for the computer, but with a much faster speed. Hooking this 
                        up to a binary counter made with the same chip as the Program Counter Module, this counter will count from 0 to 3, and then back 
                        down to 0 very quickly, repeating again and again. Since the EEPROM's have 11 address lines and only 8 so far are being used, I 
                        will hook up the address 9 and 10 to the output of the counter. Based on the value stored in these two address bits, the EEPROM will 
                        output the information for the decimal in that position. For example, if the input value was 142, the 8-bit binary value for 142 is 
                        the inputs to the EEPROM address 0 through 7. The address input 8 and 9 will come from the counter, and in these different addresses
                        will be stored a (empty), 1, 4, and 2, to make up 142. At this point, all 4 of the digits will alternate quickly between empty, 1, 4, and 2.
                        To make the 4 only show up on the tens-place decimal display, I will use another chip, 74LS139, that will creates a one-cold encoding 
                        from the output of the counter. This chip has 4 outputs, and exactly 1 of them is LOW depending on if the input from the counter is 
                        0, 1, 2, or 3. I can then tie one of the 4 outputs directly to the cathode of one of the decimal displays, and so that display will 
                        only turn on when its corresponding output from the 74LS139 is pulled LOW. Now, the EEPROM will cycle through the four values it has stored, 
                        (empty), 1, 4, and 2. But this time, only one of the displays is allowed to turn on at once, depending on which number is being pushed 
                        by the EEPROM.

                Building the output register for this module was more complex than some of the other components to this computer, but I was 
                excited to get to learn so much more than I already knew. Learning about EEPROM's as an alternative to complex combinational 
                logic is a useful skill that I can think of many applications for moving forward. It was also a very useful exercise in creativity 
                to use a solution such as this one that cuts the hardware needed by 25%, and still has the exact same functionality. If there is any 
                one thing that would be most important to take away from this week's project, it's that there are many ways to solve a problem 
                and there may be a much simpler way that I have no idea about. In order to solve this, I should stay open-minded and always be 
                looking for new skills and tools that I can use to solve problems.
