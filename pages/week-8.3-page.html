                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Although I began college classes just last fall, I have been able to take some sophomore-level courses already 
                        and ENGR 203 is the last course in the "Electrical Fundamentals" series. By taking that class this summer,
                        I will be on track as a Junior ECE student this fall. Because this class is the last in the fundamentals series,
                        it makes sense that the lab project for this class is a term-long project that incorporates everything that 
                        we have learned so far in this series. For this reason, I decided that it was important to document this project 
                        more extensively here on my website to see how far I've come, and to see this notable landmark when I look back 
                        on my journey as an engineer. The assignment for this project is:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Design and build an audio filter light-show with a speaker module.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first step to completing this project was to choose a song that I would want to demonstrate for the lab demo.
                        The song I chose is "Hold On, We're Going Home" by Drake, and using the app Audible I created a spectrogram of 
                        the song. A spectrogram is a graph with time on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis, with magnitude of frequency 
                        indicated by a brighter color. Essentially, it shows what frequencies are most prominent in the song over time. 
                        Using this, I decided that everything under 750Hz should be filtered into the bass channel, everything above 3000Hz
                        should be filtered into the high-tone channel, and everything in between would be the mid-range channel. After 
                        choosing the song and the frequency bands and creating a top-level diagram of the entire circuit, the next 
                        step was to design the filters and speaker module.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To design the filters for the low-range and high-range channels, I used second-order active filters with 
                        Sallen-Key topology. I designed these filters to be "butterworth" filters by using prototype capacitor values 
                        for values that would be easy to obtain, like a .1uF and a .05uF that you can make with two .1uF capacitors in 
                        series. Using these prototype values for the low-pass and high-pass filters and cutoff frequencies of 750 and 
                        3000Hz respectively, I found the resistor values that I needed to build these filters. For the bandpass filter 
                        that would pass the mid-range tones, I used cascaded Sallen-Key filters where one was a lowpass filter with a 
                        cutoff frequency of 3000Hz, and a highpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 750Hz. These filters used an LM741
                        opamp, and for the speaker module which was a simple opamp circuit to amplify the audio signal in, I used an LM386 
                        opamp. After testing this circuit, I realized that there wasn't enough voltage on the output of the filters 
                        to turn on an LED, but that the filters were working properly. To fix this, I designed another stage for each 
                        filter individually which would use an LMC6032 opamp to amplify the output and drive an LED. I also included 
                        potentiometers to adjust the speaker volume and individual channel light sensitivity, and finally a switch to 
                        turn of the speaker entirely.

                This project was exciting to work on and complete because of how much of my learning I was able to apply from my previous 
                classes and how large the project was. There are certainly benefits to smaller projects that just test a specific area of 
                knowledge or skill, but I personally find it more enjoyable to work on a larger project where there are many smaller 
                problems to solve along the way. In this project, there was 5 distinct problems to solve that could've each been a small 
                project on their own. The three filters, the speaker module, and the amplification stages were all distinctly different 
                and are similar to lab projects I would've done last term in the Electrical Fundamentals series. To be able to put them all 
                together into a kind of "portfolio" project like this was exciting and extremely rewarding. Going forward I think I would 
                benefit more from spending less time on perfecting the initial desing, and try to actually build an initial design more 
                quickly. There will always be real-world application problems that you can't forsee in your design and theory, so trying to 
                get an initial design that will work and making improvements from there would've been better for this project.
