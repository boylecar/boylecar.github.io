                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this week simply with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Begin building a simple computer by understanding its components at a fundamental level.
                        </em></strong>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To achieve my goal this week I found an online course created by an electrical engineering educator, Ben 
                        Eater, who created a video series and kit for purchasing that you can follow along with and build an 8-bit 
                        computer. After watching a few of the videos and seeing the depth with which he teaches and the detail that 
                        is described, I chose to purchase this kit to learn about how a computer works at a fundamental level. Once 
                        it arrived, it was relatively straightforward to follow along with the videos and the schematic given. To ensure 
                        that I understood everything in the video and wasn't just doing as was instructed, I would ask myself the 
                        purpose of each component before disassembling and reassembling each of the clock systems without the help of 
                        the video.

                        To begin this project, the first circuit needed was the astable timer. In this case, astable refers to the fact 
                        that the timer circuit has no stable state, it is always fluctuating between two states in its output, on and off.
                        The main function of this timer works by charging and depleting a capacitor. As the capacitor is charging, the output 
                        is off. Once the capacitor reaches a certain voltage, the output switches high and the capacitor depletes at about the 
                        same rate it charges with. This creates a square wave output alternating between on and off based on the relative 
                        resistance of the potentiomenter. The next clock function, the monostable clock is much more simple, 
                        essentially pulling the output high when the button closes the circuit connected to ground because of the 
                        comparator within the 555 timer. The bistable clock uses a switch to change between the astable (automatic) timer, 
                        and the monostable (manual) timer. Although a simple switch would work, another 555 timer is used to "debounce" the 
                        switch to ensure it isn't accidentally clicked multiple times at once. Finally, several logic IC's are used 
                        to choose the correct timer system to used based on the state of the switch.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Building the clock module for the 8-bit computer that I plan to build has been the most complex of my weekly projects, 
                however, it was one of the most enjoyable as well. It was extremely interesting to learn about the numerous ways in 
                which just one IC (the 555 timer) can be used. I was also excited to have experience building something with 
                electronics that will have a real use when its finished. From there, I can imagine doing so much more with what I have 
                learned about designing electronic circuits and the components of a computer. The biggest challenge with this week's 
                project was making sure that I understood the lesson at a fundamental level. This required me to go back and rewatch 
                most of the videos at least once to ensure that I comprehend the lesson. In the future I plan to finish the other parts 
                of the 8-bit computer, and I'm looking forward to what I will be able to do with it when it's completed.
