                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:

                    <p>
                        In order to continue with this project by building the SRAM Memory, I continued to follow along with the instructions
                        and schematics provided by Ben Eater, an electronics educator. At a high level, the purpose of the SRAM module is 
                        to store information that can be used for different purposes in the computer. There will be two "modes" for programming 
                        the SRAM: manual and run. After the program is complete, I will be able to program the memory before switching the computer 
                        into run mode where it will execute the programs that I have created. The SRAM I am building has 16 possible locations in memory 
                        and 8 bits at each address for a total of 16 Bytes of SRAM memory.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        At its core, the SRAM memory unit is built on two of the same chip, the TI 74F189. This chip is a 64-bit memory 
                        unit which has 16 possible addresses where you can store 4 bits of information each. Using two of these chips in 
                        parallel, I can store a total of 128 bit of data, or 16 "words" of 8 bits each. Using a multiplexer as the input 
                        for the addresses of each of these chips, you can choose between 'programming' and 'run' mode, where the data that 
                        you write to the memory will depend on which source you want to write from. Using the dip switches included on the computer, you 
                        can set a word of memory to a specific address manually. A tristate buffer is also used to allow 
                        you to enable and disable your writing to the common bus.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Building the SRAM memory was more complex than any of the other pieces before, but for the same reason it was 
                        even more exciting to build. Before I began studying electrical engineering, I had a very limited understanding 
                        of how things like memory in a computer worked at a fundamental level. After building my own registers and 
                        physically connecting the wires on a breadboard, it is very exciting to begin to understand the fundamentals of the tools that we 
                        use every day such as cell phones and laptops. With the increase in complexity of this project, I realize how 
                        much easier it is to make a mistake, and similarly how much more difficult it is to correct one. It takes patience, 
                        persistence, and critical thinking from first principles, but eventually it's possible to debug the project and 
                        fix its errors. Next week I will look to implement different programming modes for the RAM module.
