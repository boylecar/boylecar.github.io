                    <p>
                        Another assignment will be due next week in the C++ class that I tutor for, and because I took that class in Python
                        instead, my C++ competency is not as high as I think it should be. For this reason,
                        I decided to complete the assignment for CS 162 in C++ (even though I'm not enrolled in the class) to further my 
                        skill level and familiarity with C++, and so I can better assist the students that I tutor. My goal this week was to:

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The main focus of this assignment was to learn to implement classes in C++, by creating basic implementations 
                        of private data members, public get/set methods, and the "Big 3" (copy constructor, destructor, and assignment overload
                        operator). This assignment required you to use these principles to simulate a Coffee shop, allowing the user 
                        to place and log orders, add items to the menu, keep track of revenue, and read and write information to files.
                        The "Big 3" were necessary for the classes that allocate dynamic memory, including the Shop and Menu classes.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To actually implement this program, the Shop class was defined to be the primary object on which most of the 
                        operations are performed. The Shop class has data members that store all the important information about the 
                        Shop, including name, phone, and address, as well as its Menu, and a history of its Orders. Menu is a class 
                        itself, and each Menu object contains an integer representing the number of things on the Menu, and a pointer to 
                        an array of Coffee objects. An object of the Coffee class represents one single drink (like an Americano) with 
                        small, medium, and large prices as data members. An Order class was also defined, which stores informatino about 
                        a single transaction that was made, including the number of drinks and total cost. Many methods were written to 
                        help these separate classes interact and ultimately provide the overall desired functionality.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                At first when I began this project I was unsure if it would really be that beneficial to me. After all, my true passion and 
                desired career is for electronics and circuit design, and I was uncertain that this project would be the most efficient 
                use of my time and focus. However, after pushing myself to learn more C++ and undergo the procedure of deductive 
                reasoning and logical decision-making that is required to write a program that runs effectively, I am more aware of how 
                everything you do contributes to every other thing. The more I practice programming, designing circuits, learning math,
                and any other logic-based pursuit, it is becoming more and more clear that the amount of effort I put into one pursuit has 
                a directly proportional impact on all the others.
