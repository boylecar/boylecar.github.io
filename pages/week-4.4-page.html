                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Last week I finished briefly reviewing the course content for CS 162, the first difficult Computer Science class in the curriculum at Oregon State. I wanted 
                        to be more helpful as a peer tutor, and for my own sake I wanted to improve my C++ programming skills. This week I wanted to continue with this goal and 
                        do a few more medium-sized projects that would help me gain practical experience with C++ programming. My goal this week was to:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Apply my C++ foundation to gain practical experience with C++ programming
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since my goal this week is to get better at C++ both for myself and to be a better tutor, I decided that the best way to accomplish both of these would be to 
                        finish the projects that students are working on for the CS 162 class right now. After looking at the document for the first two assignments, I wanted to see how 
                        I could build my own small project-- a game of blackjack that you can play through the terminal.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first assignment was fairly simple and involved populating a static array representing the different locations on a basketball court where a player would 
                        shoot from for a competition. It required just 1 input from the user to know where they would like to place the "moneyball" rack, then it would fill the 
                        array with randomized results of whether the player made or missed the shots at the different locations. The second assignment involved populating multiple structs
                        with information about teams and the players on that team that was written into a file. It took several user inputs to determine which stats to output, like the 
                        most points scored per team, or the player with the most points, etc. Finally, the Blackjack program that I created was pretty straightforward and involved 
                        handling the users input to "hit" or "stand", and then simulating the dealer's turn with randomized card selections.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                As I have mentioned many times before, my favorite part about being an engineer is the discomfort that comes when you sit down with a large task at hand having no clue how 
                to accomplish what you want, but knowing that by taking one step after another you will eventually reach your goal. This process is very clear to me when I am writing 
                any kind of software and this week's projects were no exception. It was extremely rewarding as well when I had people come to my tutoring hours and I was able to give them 
                advice that was extremely helpful. There are two specific examples that come to mind where the students express sincere gratitude for how much I was able to help them in 
                such a short amount of time and that they couldn't have found anywhere else.
