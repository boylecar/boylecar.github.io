                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have some experience using C++ from what I learned using Arduino's and small projects in the past, but until this week I have had only a little formal 
                        education. One of the most difficult Computer Science classes that I am a tutor for at Oregon State University is CS 162. When I took the class, they used 
                        the Python language. Now, however, the class is offered in C++. In order to better help my peers and for my own benefit of having a more broad skillbase, my 
                        goal this week was to:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Gain a solid foundation for C++ programming
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The most difficult part of CS 162 is the fact that it is the first real computer science class in the curuculum and is therefore a big jump from previous 
                        classes. Because of this, I am grateful for the advantage of having already gone through this transition when I took CS 162 in Python. For this week's project,
                        I decided the best way to gain experience with C++ would be to just review the course curriculum for a CS 162 class in C++. After talking to a friend who has 
                        taken the class in C++, I was able to get all the notes and lab exercises from the class. Each term at Oregon State is 10 weeks, so I felt like the best way 
                        to approach this week's project was to complete 1 week's worth of curriculum each day, and accept that it would take me slightly more than a week.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first days of this week's project was not too difficult considering the fundamentals of C++ are nearly identical to the fundamentals of C, a language that 
                        I am very comfortable with. Each day this week I would spend a few hours on learning the curriculum for a week's worth of content in the CS 162 notes. This became 
                        difficult when I got towards the end of the class and the topic of classes were introduced, although thankfully I had the previous experience of using Python, 
                        another object-oriented programming language, so this concept was not entirely new. What did make it difficult, however, was the new idea of the "Big 3" in C++, 
                        the Destructor, Assignment Operator, and Copy Constructor. After 10 days of learning 10 weeks of content, I feel that I have really learned a lot and will now 
                        be qualified to help the people who come in for tutoring for CS 162.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                This week's project has been one of the more difficult ones, just because of the amount of new ideas that I was learning at once. I realized, though, that the best 
                thing I can do to learn something, aside from teaching someone else, is to put it into practice. The thing that made it noticeably easier to learn all the difficult 
                concepts of this course was completing the lab assignments. Because of the precise nature of programming, it's impossible to crate somethign that works by acccident. 
                Because of this fact, it's easy to know when you've learned something if you can use what you know to create the output that you're expecting. I plan to do more with 
                C++ this next week as well, to solidify my foundation with even more practical application.
