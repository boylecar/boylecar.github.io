                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:
                    </p>

                        <strong><em>
                            Continue building a simple computer by understanding its components at a fundamental level.
                        </em></strong>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to continue with this project by building the SRAM Memory, I continued to follow along with the instructions
                        and schematics provided by Ben Eater, an electronics educator. At a high level, the purpose of the SRAM module is 
                        to store information that can be used for different purposes in the computer. There will be two "modes" for programming 
                        the SRAM: manual and run. After the program is complete, I will be able to program the memory before switching the computer 
                        into run mode where it will execute the programs that I have created. The SRAM I am building has 16 possible locations in memory 
                        and 8 bits at each address for a total of 16 Bytes of SRAM memory.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        After installing the chips that will store memory and tying its output to the computer bus, this week I built two 
                        separate modes that can access SRAM. Using a physical switch connected to +5V to indicate a logic HIGH or LOW, a control 
                        signal is passed to the select pin of a multiplexer. If this is HIGH, the SRAM will choose to change address and memory values 
                        according to the inputs indicated by the manual mode dip switches for address and binary value. Otherwise, the mux will choose 
                        to pass the input from the computer bus to the SRAM chip during run mode. In run mode, the address and value at each address 
                        can be copied in from the bus by a control pin that is put through an AND gate with the rising edge of the computer clock. This 
                        control pin will later be controlled by the CPU to update the memory when necessary. Similarly, a control pin is used to either 
                        push the address stored in memory to the bus or not. The way that the SRAM was intended to update in programming mode 
                        was to push a button that would directly connect an input to GND. Since these chips normally default no inputs as a logic HIGH,
                        this would work properly to update the memory when the button is pushed. However, the inputs would sometimes be interpreted 
                        improperly by the chip, making the memory update unreliably. To fix this, I made a simple voltage divider that connects the input pin 
                        to 5V through a small resistor when the button is not pressed. The button is in parallel with a larger resistor, so that when it is 
                        pushed, the input of the chip is shorted to GND. This solution seems to produce a much more reliable method for programming.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                At this point in my Digital Logic and Design class (ECE 271), we are just beginning to learn about how memory is stored in 
                a computer, so the timing for this week's project could not be better. I was able to apply the knowledge that I gained in 
                class about D-flip-flops and how they work to not only understand what my computer is doing at a high level, but also at 
                the internal level of the IC chips that I'm using. By being able to understand the structure of the memory arrays and how 
                these would be layed out inside the chip, I am happy to see that I'm making substantial progress towards completing my goal 
                with this project of understanding computers at a fundamental level.
