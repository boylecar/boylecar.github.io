                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Continue building a simple computer by understanding its components at a fundamental level.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to continue with this project by building the ALU, I needed only to follow the instructions
                        provided and follow along with the instructional videos for this project by Ben Eater, an electrical engineering 
                        educator online. My process would be to first watch the videos to get a broad overview of the building process and 
                        learn about how the different components work together, then assemble the project on my own using the high level 
                        circuit diagram for the ALU and looking at the datasheets for the individual chips. Finally, once I have 
                        built the module and made sure that it works, I will rewatch the instructional videos to solidify my understanding 
                        of how the ALU functions at a fundamental level.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Building the Arithmetic Logic Unit for this computer was relatively straightforward as I have already 
                        built an adder using digital logic for another project that I worked on. By constructing single bit 
                        adders that are cascaded together with carry in and carry out bits, it's relatively straightforward to
                        create the adder. What was new to me was how to perform subtraction with two's complement. By converting 
                        the number that you're subtracting into a two's complement number, you can then add it to your other 
                        input and it will produce the correct subtraction output. To convert to two's complement, I used XOR gates 
                        from all of the B register inputs so that the bits would invert when a subtraction pin was HIGH. This bit would 
                        also be pushed to the carry in input of the least significant bit to complete the two's complement number. Finally,
                        the output of the ALU was added to the bus through a tristate buffer, allowing the computer to control when it 
                        should activate.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                The more that I progress with this project, the more excited I become to see everything start to come together.
                What started as a project that I was doing to push myself as an engineer and felt like work has now become 
                something that I finish my homework more quickly to complete. As I learn more and more about building circuits, 
                I have naturally become much more curious about the potential projects that I could build. Even thoguh I just 
                finished this week's project, I'm already excited to build the next module and continue seeing my computer 
                start to come together. Overall I am thankful that I had the idea to start doing an engineering project every 
                week, as I think it has had a massive effect on my skills as an engineer and I am confident that it will pay off 
                in the long run in my career.
