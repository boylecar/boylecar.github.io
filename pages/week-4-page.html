                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        When I was only about 10 years old, I was gifted a Mickey Mouse wristwatch for Christmas by my aunt 
                        and uncle. Both my passion for watches and my watch collection began at that time and would continue 
                        to grow gradually, even to this day. Now I own many different watches of all different kinds, sizes, 
                        and colors. All of my favorites, however, are automatic watches. This means that there's no electricity or 
                        battery powering the watch, and that its powered exclusively by mechanical winding of the spring, either by 
                        hand or through the natural motion of your wrist as you wear it. Naturally, if you don't wear an automatic 
                        watch for multiple days at a time, it will lose its power and eventually stop turning.

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Because I already have basic knowledge about how to use and control an Arduino (a programmable circuit board with 
                        microcontroller), I decided I would use this to control a stepper motor that would rotate the watch over time.
                        First I had to purchase a kit for the stepper motor and learn how to program it to rotate how I wanted it to.
                        Once I learned how to control the motor, I would have to create an apparatus to hold the watch itself, and a 
                        sturdy base to mount the motor to that keeps it still. The most cost effective way to achieve this for me 
                        is to use a 3D printer. For the base, I wanted to use some kind of wood that looked relatively nice and 
                        was heavy enough to counter the weight of the watch and winding mechanism. After the 
                        motor operates consistently and I create the base and watch holder, the only thing left is to assemble 
                        everything and hide the wires as much as possible to make the project look neat.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first step for my project this week was purchasing a few stepper motors. As I waited for them to 
                        arrive in the mail, I wrote the code for my Arduino that would control the stepper motors. Once they 
                        did arrive, it was easy to plug one into the arduino to be activated. Additionally, I created a CAD model 
                        based on the schematics of the stepper motor that would create a tight fit for the stepper motor and 
                        the watch pillow too. However, the first model did not fit as desired. Even with a second itteration 
                        of a similar model, I still had not created a good enough piece to hold the watches and attach to the 
                        motor. Additionally, I had to abort the plan I had for machining a piece of aluminum to create a strong 
                        connection with the stepper motor because I didn't have access to a small enough drill bit. At the end 
                        of the week, I did not have the completed product I had envisioned, but I have still learned important 
                        lessons and skills through this week's project.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Originally I had planned to complete the movement mechanism as well as the base on which I would mount 
                the motor. However, I ran short on time due to several inadequate models of the watch holder and aluminum 
                connector piece. I had 
                the option to either finish my project in a rush or take the time to create something that was of a 
                higher quality. I decided on the latter, and on not taking shortcuts in my work. I learned the valuable lesson 
                that your project is not always going to follow the timeline you expect, and planning ahead by leaving room for 
                mistakes is important. Also, I believe I made the right decision by not just "throwing together" an inadequate 
                product just to meet my deadline. I think it's more important and more valuable to prioritize the quality of my 
                product than taking shortcuts. I still feel satisfied with this project having gained the experience of using 
                a 3D printer, spending more time using the milling machine, and programming an Arduino and designing/building 
                functional circuits.
