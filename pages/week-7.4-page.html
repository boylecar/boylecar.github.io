                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am very interested in pursuing a career related to electronics, circuit design, and PCB design, and so I decided 
                        that it would be good to expand on the circuits we are already building in my Junior Design class. Because we 
                        have already been talking about applications of amplifiers in my classes, my goal this week was pretty straightforward,

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        This week in our lab for Junior Design we were required to build a few different kinds of amplifiers, including a 
                        basic non-inverting amplifier with two supplies, an inverting amplifier with two supplies, and finally a single-supply 
                        inverting amplifier that is DC-biased to half of the supply voltage. Finally, I used the same opamp chip to 
                        build a precision rectifier with a high-frequency diode that stabilizes the output voltage and prevents any 
                        amplification of the input signal.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The circuit templates for these circuits were already given to us for the use in lab, so most of the work for this 
                        week's project was in choosing the component values, building the physical circuits, and testing/validation. Because 
                        of the direct feedback in these opamp circuits and the very high input impedance, it is possible to make amplifiers 
                        that have extremely precise gain, determined simply by a voltage divider that creates a specified voltage at the 
                        opamp input terminals. Using a 4.7k resistor and a 1.2k resistor to set the gain, I had a gain of about 4 for the 
                        inverting amplifier, (A = R2 / R1) and about 5 for the non-inverting amplifier (A = 1 + R2/R1). Finally, I was also 
                        able to build the precision rectifier so that it had an output that perfectly followed the input signal.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                It's always very rewarding for me to actually get to build the thing that I am designing, and so exciting to use the 
                oscilloscope to visually see what happens to a signal at different points in the circuit. One concept that I find 
                fascinating is the fact that feedback in a system is what allows us as engineers to make much more precise designs. When I 
                was learning about how to build my 8-bit computer a long time ago, I remember hearing that "feedback is what allows for 
                complex systems." In the context of that project, it wasn't until I added a conditional jump instruction (a form of feedback 
                in computer architecture) that my computer could really do anything meaningful. A comparison was also made to that of the 
                human mind, which is an extremely complex structure with very strong feedback. At a much simpler level, I am using feedback 
                in these designs to extremely narrow the precision of these circuits. The importance of feedback across the board is something 
                very interesting that I have began to notice more and more.
