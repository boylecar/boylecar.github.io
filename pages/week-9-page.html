                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        After creating a more simple electronics configuration for my Automatic Watch Winder, the next 
                        most significant task to improve my project was to drastically improve its visual appeal. My first 
                        prototype for the physical housing of the watch box left much to be desired in terms of its aesthetic 
                        appeal, so that's the challenge that I wanted to take on this week. Therefore, my overall goal for this 
                        week's project was the following: 
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Create a better solution for the physical housing of my watch winder with high visual appeal.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to create a better physical housing for my watch winder, my first important task would be 
                        to choose a better material. After I have done that, I will need to measure how big the interior of the 
                        box needs to be. From there I will create drawings of each peace of my material to be cut, and then begin 
                        the actual processing of cutting and assembling the pieces to make a box. I will have to take into account 
                        how to configure the electronics, mount the motor, and stabilize the watch pillow holder if its going to be 
                        much heavier than before.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Beginning this project was exciting because I got to start by going to a specialized local wood store which 
                        carries many kinds of beautiful exotic woods in colors like purple and even black. After purchasing the 
                        large piece of Sapele wood, I took it home to cut into pieces. Before doing so I measured the amount of interior 
                        space I needed for the electronics and the watch winding piece, then calculated the dimensions of each 
                        piece of wood and how they were all going to fit together. First I planed the board down to 3/4 in. thickness, 
                        then used the jointer on one length of the board to make it square. Next I used the miter saw to cross cut the 
                        pieces at the correct length and then the table saw to rip them to the correct width. To finish off for this week's 
                        project, I ended by cutting off a corner around the entire perimeter of one side of the board that is half its thickness 
                        to create a rabbet joint on all edges of the box.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                I often get the most excited when I am able to combine my knowledge of electronics with making a physical product to create something with 
                real value. This week, I was able to do just that by both finalizing the elctronics needed to create my automatic 
                watch winder and taking the initial steps needed towards constructing the physical model of the box. It feels 
                very rewarding to watch a high-quality product come together, something that is similar to what many established 
                companies can sell for over $500. Until I began this project specifically, the distance between myself and someone 
                who is able to create and sell something valuable seemed very large. However, now I realize how relatively simple it 
                is to simply start a project and keep making improvements, learning along the way, until you're eventually good at 
                what you do and can create something of high value.
