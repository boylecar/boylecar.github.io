                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the same reason as my previous few weeks of working on this project, my passion for watches and electronics 
                        has led me to try and create an automatic watch winder to recharge automatic watches by rotating them over time.
                        After last week, I have now created a base for the box that will house the automatic watch winder. Naturally it became 
                        clear that the next step in my project was to add the modifications and details needed to supply power to the 
                        project, and create the cylinder that holds the watch and will rotate in the box.

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To approach the first challenge of supplying power to the watch winder, I first had to purchase a power supply
                        and receiver so I could simply plug the watch winder into the wall when it's complete. I decided to use a 
                        5V barrel jack for its simplicity, and purchased a 2.1mm barrel jack receiver as well. Similarly, I purchased 
                        a switch to allow the user to turn the power on and off easily without having to unplug the cable. After installing 
                        both of these, I will need to then work on the cylindrical watch holder. To make this piece, I will use 
                        a nice piece of walnut wood that contrasts well with the red wood of the rest of the box. First I'll need 
                        use several pieces glued together to create a large walnut block. Then I'll remove a section from the 
                        middle of the block where the watch will eventually be placed. Finally, I just need to turn the piece on 
                        a lathe to create a rounded outside.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, to create a hole for the power supply I simply had to find a drill bit that fit the size of the 
                        power receiver. Because it was a tight enough fit, there's no real reason to secure it with a nut on the 
                        inside as well. Creating the hole for the power switch was much more difficult however. Because it was 
                        a square hole of an odd size, it was not a simple task. After weighing different solutions, I decided the 
                        most effective would be to learn to use a CNC machine that I have access to and use it to cut the hole to 
                        the correct dimensions. I spent several hours learning how to program the machine to make the cuts needed, 
                        and practiced first on a test piece of wood. Finally I was able to produce the exact shape I needed, and 
                        secured the switch with a nut on the outside of the box. To create the watch holder, I cut a walnut board at
                        intervals to match the interior height of the box, making sure that the side grain of the wood is what I 
                        will be able to see in the end. I glued these pieces together and after letting it dry, used a band saw 
                        to cut the wood into three pieces. From there I could make similar cuts with the band saw to the middle 
                        piece of wood that will create a gap for the watch to sit in. I also made a square groove on the back side 
                        so that my motor can attach to this middle piece with a square key and turn the cylinder. My final task for 
                        this week was to glue these three pieces back together and prepare it to be cut with the lathe next week.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                This week I made substantial progress on my project, although I still wasn't able to turn the watch holder on the 
                lathe. I'm satisfied with the modifications I made this week and I think my project is coming together nicely. It
                was also exciting to learn how to use a CNC machine because of all the future applications where I may be able to 
                use it. The CNC machine is very good at making precise, accurate, cuts for applications like this week's changes. 
                However, some limitations are the size and kind of wood that can be used, where I can almost exclusively use a 
                rectangular piece of wood as the stock. Overall, my project is coming together much slower than I had initially 
                planned on, but I'm glad that I chose to take my time to create something of high quality, rather than somehting 
                cheap and made quicly. Compared to my first design, the current state of my project has improved drastically 
                to become something genuinely valuable that I would have purchased myself.
