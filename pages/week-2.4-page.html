                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Last year I joined Global Formula Racing (GFR), an engineering club that we have at Oregon State University. I didn't yet have the technical knowledge to 
                        really contribute as much as I would've liked, but this year I am much more confident in my knowledge and ability. I have been assigned with an upcoming project 
                        that will require extensive use of Altium for PCB design. Since I've never used Altium I wanted to get a head start by building my own basic circuit with Altium. 
                        Since I just built a BJT Amplifier last week, I felt like this would be a good circuit to start with. My goal for this week was to:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Design a PCB for the BJT Amplifier circuit I designed last week.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most of the time I would spend on this week's project will not be highly technical or complex, but rather more focused on learning the basic tools of the Altium 
                        software. First I would need to spend a few hours learning the basic principles of how PCB's are manufactured, the different layers of a PCB, the common terms 
                        related to PCB design, and basic design principles. From here I would start building my own circuit in a schematic, then design the layout for the PCB for manufacturing.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first step necessary to design a PCB was to first recreate the schematic in Altium. To do this I also made sure that all of the components used were components 
                        in the GFR library that I would have easy access to. This meant that I had to be creative in the way I created equivalent resistors, so that I could get values 
                        that were as close as possible to the values I used in my simulation and circuit prototype last week. Once I created the schematic with the correct components, 
                        I imported it into a new PCB file. In this file is where I organized the components in a symmetrical and orderly way so that the layout of the board was intuitive and 
                        electrically sound. Some considerations I made were to have inputs on the left and outputs on the right, and have Vcc at the top and GND at the bottom. Proper labels make 
                        it easier to solder components later, and I also included vias where I can attach the input and output leads.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                The project I did this week has been one of the most exciting for a unique reason. Before I started studying electrical engineering, PCB's always seemed like complete 
                magic that seemd impossible to fully comprehend. Just 1 year after starting college, it's so exciting to be able to look back out far I have come, where I am now able to 
                start designing my own circuits and making them into a PCB when until very recently that seemed like a complete fantasy. I'm just as excited as ever to continue the learning 
                process and continue to learn new skills on my way towards becoming a great engineer. Specifically, I am most interested in designing complex electronics related to 
                communication and radio frequency applications for a similar reason. The fact that we can communicate to satellites in space with a precise combination of electrical signals 
                is still mistifying and extremely interesting.
