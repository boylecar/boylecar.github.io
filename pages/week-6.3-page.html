                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Maybe the single best idea that I have had in terms of how it has impacted my career as an engineer has been 
                        the challenge to complete a personal engineering project every single week. If this is the case, then my next best 
                        idea has been to build a website to track and reflect on my progress to see how far I have come, as well as acting as
                        an informal project portfolio. The next natural progression to improve my website would be to learn how to host it 
                        myself, and cut out my dependence on GitHub to host the website. This week I set out with the following goal in mind:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Host my Project Portfolio Website entirely myself, without the need of a 3rd party host.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As a reward for being the first to complete an extra credit challenge in my Digital Logic and Design class, I 
                        received a DE1-SoC FPGA, which is a unique FPGA that also contains an ARM processor. Because the FPGA also has a 
                        CPU, it's possible to install a version of Linux onto the FPGA and host a website through the Linux OS connected to 
                        the internet with an Ethernet cable. The major obstacles for this project would be actually installing Linux onto 
                        the ARM processor, being able to communicate with Linux on the FPGA (since it doesn't have a monitor), and setting 
                        up the website for hosting so that it is accessible to the public and not just the local network.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        What initially seemed to be just a few simple steps that I needed to take in order to complete this project turned 
                        into a large amount of extensive research to understand the underlying fundamentals of what I was actually trying 
                        to accomplish. I have little experience with computer networking prior to this project, so almost all of my time 
                        was spent researching terms and concepts as opposed to actually implementing what I was learning. Initially I had 
                        to learn the protocol for installing software onto the ARM processor as specified by Intel who manufactures the FPGA.
                        After installing the Linux version recommended by Intel and initializing a Linux shell to communicate with it, I 
                        faced limitations with the very limited Linux version provided by Intel. I was unable to use the hosting application 
                        on the image, and because it didn't contain a package manager I decided to try and install a more capable Linux version.
                        After installing Ubuntu and setting up a new shell, I was able to access the internet and send and receive files between 
                        a computer on my local network and the FPGA. However, after many attempts using different methods, I was not able to 
                        set up a basic Apache server on the FPGA to be accessed by another computer on the local network.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Overall, I'm not very satisfied with the end result of this week's work. I was hoping to be able to upload what I'm writing now 
                onto the FPGA directly for my website that would be hosted myself, but instead I will have to continue using GitHub for now. I 
                do feel that I have made immense growth in terms of my knowledge of computer networking fundamentals which is definitely something 
                that I don't overlook. I do my absolute best to learn and grow from my mistakes and failures, and I think that week's project is a 
                perfect opportunity for that. Even though the project did not turn out how I wanted, I was still able to gain valuable knowledge 
                that I'm sure I will be able to utilize in the future for projects that involve networking. I would like to come back to this project 
                at a later time with a fresh perspective in order to finish it properly, but for now I have decided that I have reached a point of 
                diminishing returns with my working on this project and my career would benefit more from moving on to next week's.
