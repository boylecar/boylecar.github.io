                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For over a decade I have loved and collected watches, and I've wanted to create new things for 
                        even longer than that. This project was a great to push myself and develop completely new skills 
                        while creating something new and useful. My purpose this week was to put finishing touches on this 
                        project that I have spent so many hours working on, and my overall purpose with this project was to 
                        learn as much as possible and:

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        When I initially began this project in week 4 of my previous term, I had relatively no idea about 
                        how to even approach such a large project. I simply started by doing what I thought would be the 
                        most simple part first, and made incremental changes each week until I was finally satisfied with 
                        my product. As I go forward, I now understand the importance of an initial high-level plan with a 
                        general outline of how to proceed. For this project, my first steps were to first design the system 
                        that would transfer power from a source to a motor that would spin. Second, I would have to design the 
                        housing that would hold the watch itself, and finally I would need to design and build a box of some 
                        kind that would internally house the entire project.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Beginning when I first set out to do this project, I had to first purchase the materials. I bought 
                        a set of stepper motors that I could use, and then programmed my Arduino to control the stepper motor. 
                        At this point I used my laptop to power the Arduino. Proceeding further I learned to use a 3D printer 
                        to print the cylinder that would hold the watch inside. Certainly the most complicated part of this 
                        process to learn was how to program a microcontroller with Assembly Language. After mnay failures, I was 
                        finally able to program a PIC microcontroller to perform the controlling of the stepper motor. I then 
                        learned to design PCB's, and made 2 iterations of a PCB that would allow the microcontroller to communicate 
                        with the stepper motor. I spent a few weeks working on building the physical box out of wood that I 
                        purchased, learning how to use the different shop tools I needed along the way. Finally, I have finished 
                        my project after many hours of work and close two quarters of school.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Finishing this projects has been one of the most rewarding experiences because of how much growth I can see looking
                back. When I first started this project, I had almost no experience with 3D printing, circuit design, microcontrollers, 
                woodworking, PCB design, or even how to approach an engineering project. Now that I have substantially expanded my 
                skills and seen a project of my own progress from start to finish, I believe I have a much better foundation for 
                approaching an engineering problem in a better way. I now understand the importance of planning a large 
                project and how I should approach a large engineering project in a more systematic way in the future. More than 
                anything, I want to continue to challenge myself as much as I have with this project to learn new skills 
                every single week.
