                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As would be expected due to my choice of major, I am highly interested in understanding any system or product that 
                        uses electricity. The most important and prevalent today broadly fits under the category of "computer."
                        In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of electronics and more specifically computers, I started off 
                        this project with the goal of gaining more knowledge about the fundamentals of a computer. The 
                        best way for me to really understand such a complex system is to start building it myself. The goal I 
                        defined clearly for this week is:
                    </p>

                        <strong><em>
                            Continue building a simple computer by understanding its components at a fundamental level.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Now that almost everything on my computer is installed and functional, the next step to make it more functional is to organize 
                        all of the control signals in one place. Right now, you would have to manually adjust signals HIGH or LOW to cause anything 
                        interesting to happen on the computer. To make it better, I want to be able to program it to perform these operations by itself.
                        Similar to the way I built the output register, I will use EEPROM's to replace combinational logic. Based on the current 
                        step of the current function, the EEPROM's will activate a signal by driving the output HIGH, turning on the signal. If it 
                        is an active LOW signal, then the signal will first be driven through an inverter before reaching the chip. All of the non-inverted 
                        signals are attached to an LED so I can visually see when a signal is active or not.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The most challenging and time-consuming part of this week's project was simply wiring everything together in a way that is neat and 
                        organized. After I had attached all the wires properly through the inverters and to the LED's, I connected the inputs 
                        of the LED's to the outputs of the EEPROM's corresponding to the correct signal. Using a similar method to the way that 
                        the output register cycles through 4 states, I used the 74LS161 binary counter to construct a similar counter for values from 
                        0 to 7 that will act as the instruction step counter. The way that the CPU will work is that based on the current state of 
                        the instruction register, which informs which instruction we are performing, and the current state of the step counter, which 
                        indicates the current step of the current function, the EEPROM will update the signals for the next operation. Using the 
                        Arduino programmer that I had built previously, I programmed the EEPROM to store the information which will turn on the control 
                        signals for a given instruction and step.

            <p> 
                Although this week was potentially the most time-consuming of any other week because of all the wiring and writing the program 
                for the EEPROM, it was by far the most rewarding. Being able to hook up my computer and watch it run for the first time was 
                the most rewarding feeling I have had from any project so far. After spending countless hours trying to understand and build 
                each little peice from scratch, it's very exciting to finally reach a point where the computer does something useful. In a previous 
                project, I had to use Assembly Language to program a microcontroller. At the time, I knew very little about what was actually 
                happening. Now that I have had a more formal introduction by doing this project, it's very exciting to look back on how much I have 
                learned in just 6 months from when I knew absolutely nothing about electronics, much less about how to build any.
