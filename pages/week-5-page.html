                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the same reasons I mentioned in my project for last week, I wanted to continue building an automatic
                         watch winder. Since I was young I have been fascinated by every aspect of watches. I collect many 
                        watches and I am always interested to learn more about their mechanisms or watch history and design. 
                        Automatic watches are widely regarded as the most practical, since wearing it every day means the watch 
                        will never lose power. However, if you don't wear them every day the power drains quickly after one or multiple 
                        days. To solve this, I wanted to create a mechanism that would wind my automatic watches for me on the days 
                        when I don't wear them. Because I have already begun this project,
                        I will keep the same overall goal:

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To achieve my goal this week, the first thing in my plan is to create a more precise watch holder model for 3D printing.
                        To do this I will purchase a set of calipers that are acurrate enough to create a better piece. Next I 
                        will need to build the box that will actually hold the motor and winder, ensuring that it's stable enough 
                        and heavy enough so that the motor's torque won't unintentionally move the box itself. Once I have constructed 
                        all the individual pieces, I need to re-write the Arduino code that tells the controller when to turn the motor. 
                        I want to be able to easily set the amount of times the watch will turn each day so I don't have to unplug it 
                        or worry about the watch being overwound and potentially damaged. Finally, I will assemble all the pieces and make 
                        any changes if necessary.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Building off what I already created last week, my first task this week was to create a more precise 
                        watch holder that creates a tight fit with the watch pillow that will sit inside it. Previously I had 
                        used a ruler that I thought would be accurate enough, although it turns out that it wasn't. I purchased 
                        a set of calipers accurate to .001 inches and used it to measure the size of the watch pillow. In my new 
                        CAD model of the watch holder piece, I changed the dimensions to just .005in. above the actual dimensions
                        on each side to account for slight imperfections with the 3D printer. I then did the same with the stepper 
                        motor, modeling the watch holder so it will fit perfectly. After waiting for the print to finish and ensuring
                        that it did in fact fit, I then went to create the physical box to house the motor and watch holder. I used 
                        left-over wood from my week 1 project that I first cut to the right dimensions to fit the watch holder with 
                        a small amount of space, then used a drill press and jigsaw to cut out the right sized hold for the motor to 
                        fit in the back of. I used screws to secure a connection between the 5 pieces of wood. After plugging the motor 
                        into the controller and Arduino, and placing the watch in its holder, I got to see that my project worked exactly 
                        how I had designed it after all.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Overall this has been the most rewarding experience so far. Although it took longer than I initially planned, I am beyond 
                glad that I took my time to finish the project thoroughly. I created a product that is has a genuine purpose and adds value 
                to my own life. It was also very exciting to learn more about the Arduino on a deeper level and create a project of my own 
                without having to follow a guide. This project has made me even more excited to become an electrical engineer where 
                I will be able to use my knowledge of electronics and programming to create products that are exponentially more 
                valuable. I would like to do more with this project in the future, where I think my next steps would be to learn 
                how to program my own microcontroller in order to fit everything on one breadboard. After that, I would be interested
                in learning PCB design and production to create a single PCB that would control my motor for a much lower cost and more 
                efficient system.
