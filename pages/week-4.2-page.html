                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        This week's project was unique in the way that the opportunity came about. I am currently taking 
                        ECE 271, Digital Logic & Design, where we learn about the fundamentals of circuit design and using 
                        logic gates. On Wednesday night, my professor sent an email stating that the first 3 students to 
                        build a functioning timer on their FPGA using SystemVerilog would be gifted a Terasic De1-SoC FPGA 
                        board for free. Within 5 minutes I signed up for his earliest office hours on Friday morning where I would be able to show 
                        him my project. I immediately got started on my goal:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Create a clock module using SystemVerilog and program it onto my FPGA.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did to get started on this project was to carefully read the instructions about what 
                        specifically we were supposed to create. The program that we were to desing would have 2 inputs, an enable 
                        pin that allows you to pause the timer, and a reset pin to set the clock back to zero. The timer would 
                        use the 2 right-most hex displays of the FPGA to count seconds up to 60, then rollover into the minutes.
                        This would repeat for the hours as well. I then created a high-level diagram of the entire system, beginning 
                        with the internal oscillator, and using different modules to create the desired outcome.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, I needed to design a counter that would count the rising edges of the internal oscillator. The output 
                        of this was fed into a comparator that compared the count to a value that is equal to the frequency. The output 
                        of this comparator was fed back into the reset pin of the counter, and also into the clock signal of a 
                        counter for the seconds. This had the effect of resetting the initial counter at exact 1 second, and incrementing 
                        the next counter by 1 exactly once per second. The output of the seconds counter was driven through a parser and 
                        then two decoders that displayed the ones and tens place of the seconds on two hex displays. The output of the seconds 
                        counter also went into a comparator that checked if the value of seconds was less than 60. If it was not, the output 
                        went through a synchronizer and was put into the reset pin of the seconds counter to reset the count to zero. Also,
                        this same wire was connected to the clock module of the a minutes module that has the same exact structure as the 
                        seconds module as just described. Once every 60 seconds, the minutes counter would increment by 1. The reset pin was 
                        put into a NAND gate with each of the rollover wires, allowing you to reset the displays at any time, and the enable 
                        pin was put into a NAND gate with the internal oscillator counter, to effectively keep the counter at 0 indefinitely, 
                        never allowing the seconds counter to increment.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                When I first got the email about the opportunity for this competition, I was very excited to experience the first 
                real challenge I've experienced in my career as an electrical engineer. It was intimidating to have 
                no idea how I was going to finish the project in just two nights, but at the same time thrilling to go through 
                the problem-solving process of creating something with a time-limit. I stayed up unti 3:30am on Thursday night, 
                and was the first person to pick up my FPGA board on Friday morning. The more I push myself in new ways when I'm 
                not sure how I'm going to succeed, I realize that I improve as a person and an engineer. As I look forward, I 
                am excited to think about all the new opportunities that I have with the new FPGA board, especially the possibility 
                of using it to host this very website or for some aerospace application that may be applicable in my future career.
