                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since I received a Polaroid camera for Christmas when I was a kid, I have loved to take 
                        pictures that capture both spectacular and simple moments. Each photo captures a unique perspective 
                        that can never be copied or replicated. Until now I have kept my close to 100 polaroids in an old 
                        cardboard shoebox. I've always wanted to find a nicer place to store them, but never found a solution 
                        that excited me. Every option was either too expensive or not any better than my current one. Because 
                        of how important it is to me to store my polaroids in a place that is safe and looks good, I knew I 
                        had found the problem I would solve this week:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Create an effective storage solution for 
                            my polaroids that is visually appealing and protective.
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        After defining my problem, the next step was to decide what criteria my design would have and how I would create it. I knew that it 
                        had to be fully enclosed with no light entering so that my polaroids wouldn't be affected. To make it 
                        look good and be strong while remaining generally cost effective, it was clear that some kind of box 
                        made from wood was my best option. Because I also had access to woodshop equipment, I settled on designing a 
                        wooden chest. The 3 major problems I had to solve were how to fit the sides together, how to attach the bottom and top, 
                        and what size it should be. By taking into account the appearance, strength, and ease of creating of 
                        different wood joints, I decided to use a rabbet joint for the sides and a tongue-and-groove joint for 
                        the bottom. The top, however, I would glue flat on the top of box and cut later so that the apparent "lid" 
                        of the box was really a little taller than just the thickness of the wood. Once the base and lid were assembled,  
                        I would sand both pieces and apply finish. Finally, I would attach the hinges and clasp with screws, making sure 
                        they were all centered. One unconventional decision I made to improve the design was to cross-cut two sides of the wood 
                        so the grain on each pair of sides was in a different direction.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the process of actually building the wooden chest, the first step was to choose the right wood.
                        I found a large piece of spare hardwood in my dad's shop that also looked great. To make both of the 
                        large sides of the board flat and parallel with each other, I put the board through the planer. After 
                        many passes and flipping the board each time, it was flat. To make the long edges square with faces, I 
                        put the board through the jointer. Now that I had a square and flat board, I began to make cuts with the 
                        miter saw to make smaller boards of the appropriate sizes. Next I made cuts using the table saw so that the 
                        sides of the box would fit together in a rabbet joint. I also cut those same pieces to create a groove where 
                        I would fit the bottom of the box. At this point, I used wood glue and clamps to secure the bottom piece to 
                        the sides and let it dry overnight. The next day I glued the top of the box flat onto the base, creating 
                        a hollow box. After it was done drying, I made a cut all the way around the box with the table saw 
                        at about 1 inch, separating the lid from the base. I used a chisel to remove the excess wood glue 
                        on the inside, and sanded inside and out with 80 grit sandpaper. Next I applied a clear gloss finish to 
                        both pieces, letting them dry by hanging them on fishing line and sanding lightly in between coats. 
                        Finally, I purchased two hinges and a 
                        clasp that I attached to the box with screws.

    What's important to have on each page?
    First, I want the viewer to know why. Whyat problem was I trying to solve? What is my purpose? Why?? What was I trying to improve?
    Next, I want the viewer to know how. What is the specific thing I did to solve my problem.
        For example, I needed something to keep my polaroids safe. So I looked at different ways to store things and the 
        materials I had,and I decided that the best way to solve my problem was to make a wooden box. (Go into more detail 
        about the process of choosing my method, like the fact that I wanted it to look good, have room for other things,
        I could use my dad's shop and his knowledge, I wanted it to be strong, not let light in, etc.
    Finally, I will tell the viewer what exactly it is that I did. What was the project and what were the exact steps I took to
        reach my final output. Talk about the skills I learned, the mistakes I made, the small problems along the way, how those
        problems help me become a better engineer, what I think and how I feel about the resulting creation, how successful I was.
        What did I learn along the way, (for the website week I learned how there is so much that I was never even aware of. Now
        that I'm building a website I realize that it's more than just the code. I have to think about the presentation as well.
        How will it be perceived? How to make it appealing? I have to make sure my writing has substance but the page is also
        visually appealing, not just a wall of text. It should have strong character and also aesthetic appeal.) (even the
        process here of writing out my thoughts is very useful, rather than just letting them all bounce around in my head)
        Describe the small decisions I had to make like wood glue or cutting first, curved or straight lines on the website, etc.
        ?Include resources I used to gain the knowledge and skills I needed to complete this project?
    Reflection. In addition to the "what" I will have a different section at the very bottom of the page for reflection,
        briefling summarizing the most important things that I learned when working on the website.
    I will also need an image gallery of several project pictures, during and after the process was complete.
        I think it would be interesting if the images alternated which side of the screen they were on as you scrolled down
        through the page, where the text would fill the whitespace. Each image would have captions.
