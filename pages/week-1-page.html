    What's important to have on each page?
    First, I want the viewer to know why. Whyat problem was I trying to solve? What is my purpose? Why?? What was I trying to improve?
    Next, I want the viewer to know how. What is the specific thing I did to solve my problem.
        For example, I needed something to keep my polaroids safe. So I looked at different ways to store things and the 
        materials I had,and I decided that the best way to solve my problem was to make a wooden box. (Go into more detail 
        about the process of choosing my method, like the fact that I wanted it to look good, have room for other things,
        I could use my dad's shop and his knowledge, I wanted it to be strong, not let light in, etc.
    Finally, I will tell the viewer what exactly it is that I did. What was the project and what were the exact steps I took to
        reach my final output. Talk about the skills I learned, the mistakes I made, the small problems along the way, how those
        problems help me become a better engineer, what I think and how I feel about the resulting creation, how successful I was.
        What did I learn along the way, (for the website week I learned how there is so much that I was never even aware of. Now
        that I'm building a website I realize that it's more than just the code. I have to think about the presentation as well.
        How will it be perceived? How to make it appealing? I have to make sure my writing has substance but the page is also
        visually appealing, not just a wall of text. It should have strong character and also aesthetic appeal.) (even the
        process here of writing out my thoughts is very useful, rather than just letting them all bounce around in my head)
        Describe the small decisions I had to make like wood glue or cutting first, curved or straight lines on the website, etc.
        ?Include resources I used to gain the knowledge and skills I needed to complete this project?
    Reflection. In addition to the "what" I will have a different section at the very bottom of the page for reflection,
        briefling summarizing the most important things that I learned when working on the website.
    I will also need an image gallery of several project pictures, during and after the process was complete.
        I think it would be interesting if the images alternated which side of the screen they were on as you scrolled down
        through the page, where the text would fill the whitespace. Each image would have captions.
