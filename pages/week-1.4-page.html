                    <h4>WHY?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As I have just began my Junior-level electrical engineering classes this fall, we have started learning about diodes and BJT transistors in Electronics I.
                        In order to gain a more fundamental understanding of the concepts that we are studying and their applications, for this week's project I wanted to build some 
                        kind of project using a BJT transistor. Being that the BJT was first used as an amplifier, I decided that this would be the best project to start with. Therefore,
                        my goal for this week was:
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        <strong><em>
                            Create a signal amplifier using a BJT
                        </em></strong>
                    </h5>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h4>HOW?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first step necessary to complete this project would be to find a circuit topology that is not too complex but still provides a substantial gain. Next I 
                        would need to choose component values that would produce a desired gain specification, and then simulate the behavior of the circuit. I would readjust my 
                        component values again and repeat until I settled on a design that could produce a gain of 15. Once I did this I could then build the physical circuit, and 
                        finally observe the output signal with an oscilloscope to verify that my circuit works as intended.

                    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I determined that the common emitter amplifier would be the best choice for the purpose of this project. The first thing I chose about this circuit is the 
                        supply voltage that I would be using. 15V was a relatively easy value to work with, and so this is what I used going forward. Before including any coupling 
                        or bypass capacitors, I first determined the ratio of Rc and Re, so that the amp would have a gain of 7.5 (Rc = 7.5 x Re). To set the DC operating point at 
                        exactly half of the supply voltage for maximum amplitude, I calculated the necessary Ic to set Vc at 7.5V. Approximating Ic = Ie allowed my to then find 
                        what Ve must be, and therefore Vb = Ve + 0.6V. Finally I used large resistors to create a voltage divider and set Vb at this voltage. Next I simulated my 
                        circuit with ngspice and found that Vc was too low. To fix this I needed to decrease Ic, and therefore decrease Ib slightly. To do this I simply modified the 
                        values in the voltage divider. After simulating again, I found that the operating point was nearly exactly at 7.5V. To finalize my design I added coupling 
                        capacitors at the input and output, and a bypass capacitor at Ve. To high frequencies, this creates a near short through the capacitor without changing the DC 
                        operating point. This resulted in nearly 2x's the gain, now being close to 15. Finally I built my circuit by soldering onto a copper plate. Using a function 
                        generator and an oscilloscope, I measured a gain of 12 for my circuit, almost reaching the target of 15.

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p> 
                Overall this week was very exciting. Until now most of my projects have been made on breadboards, a PCB, or with an FPGA. This week I was excited to actually solder 
                connections onto the copper ground plate and build the circuit this way. It gives me even more insight into how extremely complex and difficult it would be to create 
                an advanced PCB, and how magical it is to fit such complex logic and signal processing onto a tiny PCB that runs over a billion operations every second. It's also 
                rewarding to see that everything I have been learning is starting to become applicable, and that I can use my knowledge and skills to build electronics that have a 
                real, observable purpose. I have certainly completed projects with a similar result, but the fact that this basic amplifier is made exclusively with fundamental 
                circuit components and hand soldered makes it just that much more appealing.
